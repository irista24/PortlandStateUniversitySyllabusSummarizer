Yet, what currently sounds more like science fiction is just the beginning of an exciting new era that bears both incredible risks and opportunities for humankind. This interdisciplinary year-long course will delve into the fascinating relationship between non-living and living matter, life and death, nature and the artificial, humans and machines. Our inquiry will start with the fundamental question what is life. How can a finite number of non-living molecules and atoms become a complex living organism with consciousness and moral beliefs? We will explore in what ways human search for perfection is embodied in various myths and utopian visions. What does it mean to be human, cyborg, or transhuman? Nowadays, genetic engineering modifies life and synthetic biology seeks to create it from scratch. However, the social consequences are enormous. Therefore, we will examine the risks and opportunities of such technologies and how they redefine social relations and values. These changes prompt the emergence of new concepts and disciplines, such as biopower, biopolitics, and bioethics that address the new forms of discrimination and social injustice. How do these modifications of life ultimately lead to a redefinition of life itself? Through readings, movies, research, hands-on experiments in designing artificial life systems through simulations, and discussions, the students will study topics ranging from philosophy to arts, from ethics to the evolution of language, from  Christof Teuscher UNST 136A Spring 2024    "

The small size of mentored sessions (~12 students) creates an interactive environment where students get hands-on experience in developing skills in research, writing, communication, and computer technologies. Students learn how to effectively access the Internet, to judge the quality of internet sites, and to use technology to communicate with faculty and other students in class. Unless told otherwise by your peer mentor, the main session rules and guidelines apply to the mentored sessions as well.  University Studies Goals Inquiry based student learning is the cornerstone of the University Studies’ Freshman Inquiry courses.  The goals are to develop those skills that will be crucial to your academic success and beyond.  The four major learning goals of University Studies are (https://www.pdx.edu/unst/university-studies-goals):  Christof Teuscher UNST 136A Spring 2024    "
"Apr 7, 2024, Revision 2 "
"• Inquiry and Critical Thinking. Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula—problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners. • Communication. Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways—writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies. • Diversity, Equity and Social Justice. Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives. • Ethics, Agency, & Community. Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities. Active Participation and Engagement Freshmen inquiry is based on the concept of active learning. Without your full and active participation, we will be missing an essential voice—yours. What you bring to this class is yourself and your desire to participate and to learn. If you want to be successful, you need to be active, engaged, and willing to speak up. We will be learning from each other and your voice is important. As a general rule of thumb, you should aim to speak up at least once per class session. Active participation and engagement are part of your final grade. Important: What is said in the classroom, stays in the classroom. Classroom Etiquette • Arrive on time, be seated and ready when class starts. • Do not leave early, do not start to pack up your stuff before class ends.  • No side conversations. • Do not distract others with your devices, e.g., by playing games, checking social media, texting. • Remove earphones and sunglasses. • Respect each other, be kind, show empathy. • Listen, engage, participate, contribute. • Do the work you are supposed to do, e.g., don’t work on other class assignments. If there are deliverables, submit them at the end of the main/mentored session. • Act professionally. • Don’t lose a friend over an argument. • What is said in the classroom, stays in the classroom. • Follow the “campsite rule:” leave the place better than you found it. • Be willing to learn.  The classroom etiquette is part of your final grade. Attendance Attendance in FRINQ UNST classes is mandatory. If you want to be successful in this class, you need to attend both the main and the mentored session. Being on time and seated when class starts is a courtesy to the teacher and to your classmates. It’s also a matter of professionalism and good work ethic. So be on time and ready when class starts. You are considered late the moment I start class. There is no grace period and tardies cannot be made up. Should you decide not to attend class regularly, I will expect you to assume responsibility for your actions.  Absences can only be excused with documentation. Excusable absence are any absences that are scheduled without your control, e.g., jury duty, court appointments, immigration appointments, competitions (for athletes that are members of official PSU sports teams) etc.  Regular doctor’s appointments, DMV appointments, or any other appointments for which you can in general chose your appointment day/time, will not be excused. Absences due to sickness require a doctor’s note. Traffic, issues with public transportation, not being able to find parking, etc., are not a reason for an excuse. Leave a little earlier to account for delays.   Christof Teuscher UNST 136A Spring 2024    "

"No individual make up assignments of any kind are offered for missed classes or in-class assignments.  Homework For a 5-credit course, you can expect up to 10 hours of homework per week.  Grading and Assignments  The table below lists all major assignments (with their due dates) that will be used to determine your final grade in this course.  For this term, you will be selecting individual and book team challenges during week 1. Each completed challenge will earn you a given number of points. The points will be added at the end of the term for your individual and book team challenges. Your final grade will be determined as shown below.  Individual and book team challenges/points will be earned in a “binary” way, i.e., you either meet or don’t meet a challenge. There will be no partial credit. This term is NOT self-graded. Your instructor will be the judge whether you have met a challenge you have signed up for or not. You may be asked to submit appropriate evidence in support of your challenge claims.

"How to Ace this Course ""The greatest predictors of student success, as far as student behavior go, are conscientiousness (e.g., work ethic, dependability, and perseverance), agreeableness (teamwork, emotional stability), various kinds of extroversion, and openness to new experiences."" — Paul R. Sackett, Prof. of Psychology at U. of Minnesota in Minneapolis  Here are some key things to do to excel in this course: • Submit all assignments. Submit them on time. Attend class. Be on time. Be active.  • Check Canvas daily. • Read your PSU e-mail daily and respond promptly to e-mails from your mentor or instructor. • Start assignments early, ask me for feedback on drafts. • Do the readings on time, when you’re awake, lucid, and attentive.  Read them before the class when they’ll be discussed. Take notes on them. Digest them. Then go back to them after a couple of days, skim them again, review your notes, and think a little more.  Be ready to ask some reasonable questions about the readings in class.  • Take notes in class. • Participate actively in class discussions.  Be engaged.  Have fun.  Connect the readings to your own life-experience.  • Come to my office hours.  Ask me questions. Show me you care.  How to Get Help with Class-related Things? 1. Post your question(s) in the Canvas discussion forum(s). 2. Ask your peer mentor during the mentored session. 3. Come to my office hour: http://www.teuscher-lab.com/officehour 4. Send an e-mail to teuscher@pdx.edu. I always try to reply to student e-mails promptly, but please do not assume that you will get a reply within hours, especially not after 5pm and on weekends. Due to the high volume of e-mails I receive, my response times can be longer than 24h.  Early Alerts Succeeding in college does not mean that you don’t struggle in a class or classes or during particular terms. My goal as your instructor, and our goal at Portland State, is to do what we can to support all students and facilitate their success. Early Alerts is one of the ways we try to support our students. It’s a process by which your instructor can link you to academic advisors or campus support, and it’s a time for your instructors to let you know what changes you can make toward success in the course and engage in a learning partnership with you. This is a way to open up the conversation between you, your advisor, and your instructor so that together you can work out how to achieve your educational goals. Getting an Early Alert is not an indication that you will not succeed in the course. It is a call to action.  You might get an email or phone call from an advisor. Please engage in this process. Students who have taken advantage of resources offered to them are able to move forward and succeed in the course. Letters of Recommendation I am happy to write letters of recommendation for students who engaged and actively participated, students who cared, showed impeccable behavior, were role models for others, and showed leadership skills. Please give me enough advanced notice and provide me with your resume and any other relevant information. I cannot usually accommodate last-minute requests unless I have already written a letter for you. How to ask for a recommendation: http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-Ask-for-a/235968. If you ask me to write a letter for you, I will have you complete the following questionnaire: http://bit.ly/CTRecommendationRequest  Christof Teuscher UNST 136A Spring 2024    "

"Course Description:  This course introduces the American Identities cluster. Using historical and contemporary voices, this class explores how "
"traditions and tensions wit hin the United States and North America shape its cultures and sense of being ""American.""  The specific focus of "
"individual American Identities SINQ classes may differ, but each will examine the significance of key American narratives, ar tifacts, policies,  and "
"places, and will apply perspectives ranging from the arts and humanities and social sciences.  Each class will also apply the methods of cultural, "
"historical, and other modes of analysis.  "
Course Objectives:  During this course students will...  
"• Explore Diverse American Narratives: Students will examine key narratives, artifacts, policies, and places that have shaped the Unite d States "
"and North America. This includes understanding how different cultures, traditions, and historical events contribute to the  sense of being "
American.  
• Analyze Cultural and Historical Perspectives: The course aims to develop students' ability to apply methods of cultural and h istorical analysis. 
"This includes interpreting texts, understanding context, and critically evaluating different perspectives within American society.  "
"• Understand the Impact of Socio -Cultural Factors: Students will gain insight into how socio -cultural factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, "
"sexuality, and class influence American identities. Readings and di scussions will focus on the roles and contributions of various groups to "
"American society.  • Evaluate the Role of Intersectionality in American Identities: The course will emphasize the concept of intersectionality, ex ploring how "
"overlapping social identitie s and related systems of oppression, domination, or discrimination shape individual and group experiences in "
America.  
• Contemplate the Future of American Identities: Students will be encouraged to think critically about the future of American i dentities. Th is 
"includes discussing potential societal changes, envisioning future narratives, and examining how current trends might evolve and impact the "
sense of American identity.  
"Course Design:  The D2L shell for the course has divided the content into ten weekly  learning modules. With few exceptions, each module will have "
"an assigned chapter of the textbook (or PDF), audio lectures, supplementary readings and videos, a discussion board and promp t (1st Post due on "
"Mondays @ 11:55PM & Four Responses due by Saturday s @ 11:55PM), and a quiz on the assigned reading (due Sundays @ 11:55PM).  "

"Discussions (30% of Final Grade, 5 points e ach, best 8/10):  Each week  there will be a forum for group discussion of a specific philosophical topic "
related to the assigned reading. You will begin by reviewing the materials for the discussion (usually a video or text link) and writing a “1st  Post” 
(Starting a discussion thread with a 500 word post that answers the week’s discussion prompt). Then you should continue to part icipate by writing 
“Responses” to the post of three separate students.  
Both “1st  Post” and “Responses” should end with a question t hat you would like the  Mentor  or another student to answer as a means of moving the 
discussion forward.  
Your “1st Post” is due by Wednesday @ 11:55PM and your “Responses” to other students are due by the following Saturday @ 11:5 5PM  
"Each week you may earn a total of  5 points for your participation. Your “1st  Post” will be graded on its quality by earning 0, 1, or 2 points. You will "
then earn 0 or 1 point for each “Response” that you post to other students. Your Final Weekly Discussion grade will be the su m of your  8 best weekly 
grades out of a possible 30 points for the term. (Saturdays @ 11:59 PM)  
"American Identities Term Paper (20% of Final Grade):  For your American Identities term paper, you are required to craft a thoughtful, analytical "
essay that explor es a specific aspect of American identity as it relates to one of the key themes discussed in this course. Choose a theme suc h as 
"immigration, race, gender, class, or cultural expression, and focus on how this theme has shaped and been shaped by the Ameri can experience. Your "
"paper should be grounded in at least three of the readings assigned during the course, but you are also encouraged to incorpo rate additional scholarly "
"sources to support your analysis. The paper should not only summarize the readings bu t critically engage with them, examining how they interact "
with each other and contribute to our understanding of American identities. This assignment is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to 
"synthesize course materials and articulate your own pers pective on the complex tapestry of identities that define the American experience. The expected length of the paper is 5 -7 pages, double -spaced, with proper academic citations. This paper will allow you to delve deeper into a specific "
"topic, enhance your a nalytical skills, and contribute to the broader discourse on American identity.  "
Mentor Session Grade (20% of Final Grade):  The Mentor for the course will design  a separate D2L shell  for the mentor session and assignments. 
"At a minimum, weekly participation  on the mentor shell is expected and  it is difficult to pass the course without passing the Mentor "
Session.  Please check the Mentor Session Shell for exact details.  
"Disability Resources:   If you require accommodations  (e.g. special seating, interpreter, no te-taker, etc.), please inform your instructor immediately. "
Students with disabilities should register with the PSU Disability Resource Center  (503-725-4150) to document their need for accommodations and 
obtain support services. I will work with you to arr ange the supports you need in this class.  
Cultural Resource Centers: The Cultural Resource Centers (CRCs) create a student -centered inclusive environment that enriches the university 
"experience. We  honor diversity, explore social justice issues, celebrate cultural traditions, and foster student identities, success, and leadership. "
"Our centers include the Multicultural Student Center, La Casa Latina Student Center, Native American Student & Community Center, Pan African "
"Commons, Pacific Islander, Asian, Asia n American Student Center and the Middle Eastern, North African, South Asian  program. We provide "
"student leadership, employment, and volunteer opportunities; student resources such as computer labs, event,  lounge, and study spaces; and extensive "
programmin g. All are welcome!

About
your

Erica
Meryl
Thomas
(she/her)
I
am
an
"artist,"
"educator,"
labor
"organizer,"
and
designer.
From
2017-2020
I
co-directed
Works
Progress
"Agency,"
an
interdisciplinary
design
consultancy
based
in
"Portland,"
OR.
WPA
brought
creativity
and
equity
to
"workplaces,"
and
created
opportunities
for
artists
to
make
a
living
at
their
work.
From
2017–2020
WPA
operated
"MATTER,"
a
storefront
artspace
and
residency
program
in
Inner
SE
Portland
focused
on
building
opportunities
for
socially
engaged
artists
to
"experiment,"
exhibit
and
sell
their
work.
In
"2014,"
I
earned
an
MFA
in
Contemporary
Art
and
Social
Practice
from
Portland
State
University.
As
an
"artist,"
I
utilize
a
multitude
of
media
and
forms
to
explore
concepts
like
"vulnerability,"
"solidarity,"
and
pleasure.
My
projects
o
use
dialogue
or
oral
histories
to
build
relationships
and
community
and
create
opportunities
for
"collaborative,"
public
engagement.
My
work
manifests
in
the
form
of
"books,"
"installations,"
"printmaking,"
"events,"
"performance,"
and
more.A
few
of
my
projects
and
exhibitions
include:
Art
Talk
Bus
Stop
"(producer,"
2019–present)
a
youth
education
program/podcast
and
KBOO
Community
Radio
"show,"
where
high
school
students
interview
artists
and
creatives
about
how
they
do
their
work
and
how
they
make
a
"living,"
Nobody
Wants
to
Work
Anymore
"(artist,"
Nov
"2022),"
a
solo
exhibition
on
the
duality
of
labor
and
value
in
the
contemporary
"workplace,"
and
Obscurity:
Life
Inside
the
Smoke
"(curator/artist,"
Sept–Dec
2023)
an
exhibition
about
the
human
relationship
with
wildﬁre
smoke
through
the
interpretation
of
six
Portland
area
"artists,"
at
the
World
Forestry
Center
in
"Portland,"
OR
in
which
I
worked
with
incarcerated
wildland
ﬁreﬁghters
to
create
an
interactive
installation.
I
have
been
an
artist
in
residence
at
Casa
Tres
Patios
in
"Medellín,"
Colombia
(2019)
and
PLAYA
at
Summer
"Lake,"
OR
"(2020/21),"
and
at
Nafasi
Art
Space
in
Dar
es
"Salaam,"
Tanzania
(2022)
where
I
have
produced
"exhibitions,"
"publications,"
and
workshops.
In
addition
to
my
art
"background,"
I
have
over
15
years
of
experience
as
a
"producer,"
project
"manager,"
and
art
"director,"
both
at
production
and
design
agencies
and
on
independent
projects.
I’ve
been
part
of
the
PSU
community
since
moving
to
Portland
in
"2008,"
ﬁrst
as
a
Producer/Director
of
multimedia
"projects,"
then
as
a
graduate
student
and
Teaching/Graduate
Assistant
in
the
MFA
in
Contemporary
Art
&
Social
"Practice,"
and
now
as
an
adjunct
faculty
member
in
University
Studies
as
well
as
the
Co-Chair
and
Chair
of
Political
Action
for
our
adjunct
faculty
"union,"
PSUFA
.
When
I’m
not
"teaching,"
making
"art,"
or
organizing
in
my
"community,"
I
enjoy
"traveling,"
backcountry
"expeditions,"
gardening
and
"cooking,"
live
"music,"
and
dance
parties.
Cam
Ericksen
(they/them
)
I
am
a
"mixed-race,"
"two-spirit,"
queer
counseling
student
with
a
focus
in
relationship
and
family
therapy.
I
currently
serve
as
a
counselor
intern
at
William
Temple
House
in
NW
Portland
as
I
ﬁnish
the
last
year
of
my
Masters
program.
A
few
other
things
about
me
aside
from
being
a
student
and
a
"counselor-in-training,"
I
have
hobbies
in
gardening
and
"ceramics,"
am
"partnered,"
enjoy
kayaking
with
"friends,"
and
love
to
cook.
I
completed
my
undergraduate
degree
at
PSU
and
am
familiar
with
numerous
resources
on
campus
so
please
never
hesitate
to
reach
out
to
me
(ce7@pdx.edu).
The
mentor
role
is
one
I
value
and
appreciate
for
the
interdisciplinary
learningcommunity
we
create
together.
While
there
are
a
few
things
I
can
share
and
oﬀer
to
"you,"
the
students
I
work
with
consistently
bring
a
wealth
of
knowledge
and
experience
that
inﬂuences
my
understanding
and
work
as
a
mentor
with
UNST.
I
look
forward
to
our
work
together
this
term!
Instructor
Communication/Role:
I
am
available
some
weekdays
during
business
"hours,"
9:00
a.m.
–
5:00
p.m.
via
email.
I
aim
to
respond
to
your
email
within
48
hours.
I
generally
do
not
respond
on
the
weekends
or
on
school
holidays.
I
am
happy
to
make
arrangements
on
an
individual-basis
for
zoom
oﬃce
hours.
Please
send
an
email
request
to
my
@pdx
email
to
arrange
a
Zoom
meeting
if
the
weekly
standard
times
don’t
work
for
you.
I
encourage
your
"communication,"
so
please
don’t
hesitate
to
be
in
touch!
My
job
is
to
serve
as
a
"facilitator,"
"advisor,"
and
to
be
an
"honest,"
"vulnerable,"
supportive
co-learner
in
our
community.
Our
work
together
should
build
a
context
for
thinking
more
deeply
as
we
explore
design
thinking
through
a
community-based
lens.
Communication
is
key
to
collaboration
and
building
relationships.
I
hope
to
provide
you
opportunities
to
get
to
know
your
classmates
as
well.
Your
Mentor
is
responsible
for
giving
you
guidance
on
"assignments,"
"feedback,"
and
facilitating
group
work
during
your
Mentor
Sessions.
Workload
This
class
is
4
credit
hours
(most
PSU
classes
are
within
the
3-6
range).
One
credit
is
equivalent
to
approximately
one
hour
of
lecture
or
class
per
"week,"
or
two
hours
of
lab/studio
activity
per
week.
PSU
advisors
usually
recommend
at
least
2
hours
of
work
time
outside
of
class
per
week
for
every
credit
hour
of
lecture
or
class.
Since
this
is
a
4
credit
"course,"
and
is
activity-based
(not
lecture)
you
should
allow
3-4
hours
per
week
to
absorb
course
content
through
"readings,"
"videos,"
"podcasts,"
and
participating
in
small
group
discussions
about
the
course
content.
This
includes
a
weekly
Mentored
Discussion
which
will
take
place
in
Canvas.
You
should
allow
approximately
2-4
hours
per
week
for
working
on
your
Human-Centered
Design
Project.
This
will
stretch
over
the
entire
term
structured
through
a
series
of
weekly
assignments.

Main
Session
Participation
Your
Participation
grade
is
an
assessment
of
your
"attendance,"
level
of
engagement
with
your
instructors
and
"teammates,"
including
utilizing
oﬃce
"hours,"
attending
Midterm
"Meeting,"
and
in
the
second
half
of
the
term
will
include
your
review
by
your
self
and
your
teammates
in
the
the
Self/Peer
Evaluation
survey.
You
are
required
to
attend
class
each
week.
This
class
meets
only
once
per
week
so
2
or
more
absences
early
in
the
term
may
result
in
a
recommendation
to
drop
the
"class,"
and
later
in
the
term
may
result
in
failure
of
the
class.
You
are
strongly
encouraged
to
take
advantage
of
oﬃce
hours
with
"me,"
even
if
you
aren’t
having
a
"problem,"
but
especially
if
you
are
struggling.
Please
send
me
a
message
on

or
email
to
set
up
a
time.Mentor
Session
(30%
of
ﬁnal
grade)
Weekly
participation
in
this
course
is
essential.
Each
"week,"
you
will
write
a
response
and
upload
it
to
Canvas
in
advance
of
our
classroom
discussion.
At
the
end
of
the
"quarter,"
you
will
also
self-evaluate
your
participation
in
the
"course,"
and
I
will
evaluate
your
participation
in
concrete
measures
such
as
"attendance,"
participation
in
"discussion,"
assignment
"completion,"
etc.
We
understand
that
your
lives
won't
be
the
same
week-to-week
and
some
weeks
will
be
harder/busier
than
others
-
one
week
will
not
make
or
break
your
grade
in
this
course.
"However,"
attendance
is
mandatory
and
we
only
meet
once
per
week
so
students
who
miss
3
classes
will
be
subject
to
failing.
This
is
a
fast
paced
course
and
you
will
struggle
if
you
do
not
plan
your
work
time
and
turn
in
weekly
assignments
on
time.
If
you
feel
you
are
falling
"behind,"
reach
out
to
me
immediately!
Weekly
Discussion
Participation
&

you
will
be
assigned
read/watch
material
about
concepts
that
relate
to
the

Theme.
You
will
cultivate
a
classroom
community
through
conversations
about
the
course
content
in
your
weekly
Discussion
groups.
This
isn’t
possible
without
your
active
engagement.
Our
weekly
mentored
discussions
will
be
facilitated
by
me
and
your
Peer
Mentor.
You
will
generate

based
on
our
weekly
resources
"(articles,"
"videos,"
podcasts)
and
your

Key
This
is
a
highly
engaged
course.
You
are
required
to
participate
in
the
"discussions,"
workshop
"activities,"
and
groupwork.
We
will
track
your
activity
and
participation
in
discussions
throughout
the
term
as
a
component
of
your
grade.

You
will
take
part
in
a
variety
of
evaluation
methods:
"self-evaluation,"
peer
"evaluation,"
and
instructor/mentor
feedback.
If
you
fall
below
the
“Emerging”
range
on
any
piece
of
"coursework,"
we
will
discuss
the
work
and
talk
about
ways
to
get
into
the
Emerging-Proﬁcient
range.
All
students
are
expected
to
fall
in
the
Emerging-Proﬁcient
and
above
range
in
the
majority
of
their
course
work
across
our
learning.
At
midterm
wewill
have
check-ins
with
everyone
to
give
verbal
feedback
on
your
work
as
well
as
hear
how
your
design
process
is
going.
This
will
also
be
an
opportunity
to
brainstorm
and
ask
questions.
Policies:
Presence
and
participation
are
required.
Consistent
weekly
participation
is
expected
and
required
both
in
class
content
and
weekly
mentor
sessions.
Lack
of
participation
will
impact
your
grade.
Two
or
more
absences
may
result
in
failure.
Please
know
that
we
want
to
work
with
you
and
are
ﬂexible
this
quarter
depending
on
your
needs
but
this
requires
regular
communication
(before

so
we
can
make
a
plan
together.
Late
work
is
discouraged.
"However,"

Your
instructor
and
mentor
require
time
to
evaluate
your
work
and
give
feedback
and
your
team
needs
you
to
participate
on
time
each

UNST 222B -001 = Design Thinking  
Basic Course & Contact Information:  
Winter 2024  
4 credits  
Instructor Contact Information:  
Name: Erin K. Bray  
Email: ebray@pdx.edu  
Office Hours(Virtual): Schedule Individually  
Graduate Mentor Contact Information:  
Name: Abby Card  
Email: acard@pdx.edu  
Office Hours: By appointment  
About Erin (your instructor):  
I have been in Education my entire career though I am fairly new to teaching part -time at PSU. I 
"spent the first half of my career teaching High School Languag e Arts, first at Evergreen High "
School in Vancouver and then at David Douglas High School in east Portland.  I became 
interested in design thinking in 2015 after attending a professional development experience 
alongside students who were participating in a design challenge .  I immediately saw the 
potential for this kind of learning in our public school settings.  To me it felt much more 
relevant and meaningful than what I saw happening on a day -to-day basis in my classroom and 
"in schools, in general.  "
In 2016 I took a leave  of absence from my classroom role and began learning more about 
"design as a problem -solving methodology.  I was in love.  To me, design spoke to so many of my "
internal beliefs about people and the world and gave me a process for trying to approach the 
wicked problems in my own life and beyond with optimism and creativity.  I began working for 
"an educational non -profit in Portland teaching educators about the process, about how to use "
the process in their curriculums and also about how to use the process as   changemakers within 
"our education system.  In the couple years, I have switched jobs and now work for the "
"Multnomah -Clackamas Regional Educator Network full time, bringing the human -centered "
design process (aka Design Thinking) to schools in our region a nd using it to help make our 
schools more equitable and better places overall for all the humans involved.  
"I have a small family in NE Portland that includes my partner, two young -ish children, and a "
"small dog.  We like to adventure outside, garden, and p lay games.  I also thoroughly enjoy "
"knitting, weaving, sewing, and generally playing with art supplies. Finally, I have been a "
committed soccer player all of my life but mostly play with my old lady soccer team of 20 years 
"now and coach my daughter’s recre ational team, which we call The Glitter Otters.  "
I’ve enjoyed the experience of getting to work with students and PSU.  I was skeptical that the 
asychronous/virtual learning could really work for teaching design thinking but I’ve been 
pleasantly surprised and continue to try to improve that experience fo r students taking my 
class.  
About Abby (your graduate mentor):  
Find a lovely intro about Abby in this slideshow ! 
Instructor Communication & Role:  
Please allow 24 -48 hours for us to respond to your email. We will likely not respond on the 
weekends or on school holidays.  If you need to schedule a phone call with me during evenings 
"or weekends, I am happ y to do so on an individual basis.   "
"Our job is to serve as a facilitator, advisor and to be an honest, vulnerable, supportive co -"
learner in our community. Communication is key and collaboration with me and your fellow 
learners are essential for us to thr ive in this class.  
Student Workload:  
It is important to be able to budget your time for this class by thinking through the time you will 
need to complete your work and build community.  Most courses at PSU are offered for 3 -6 
credit hours. One credit is equivalent to one hour of lecture or class per week (or two hours of 
lab or studio activity per week).   
 PSU advisors usually recommend at least two hours of study time per week for every credit 
"hour of lecture or class.  Since this is a 4 credit course, you should allow 3 hours per week for "
"course content through readings, videos, podcasts and participating in small group discussions. "
The additional credit hours are made up of the 3 virtual small group meetings you will attend in 
"week 4, week 5, and week 8.  "
You should allow approximately 2+ hours per week for working on our Community -Centered 
Design Project (this will stretch over weeks 4 -10) and includes weekly assignments (see below).  
Required Texts:  
● I will provide any weekly content in the form of a rticles or videos.  
"● As far as additional expenses, you will need basic art supplies  (paper, tape, markers, "
"glue, etc..), a sharpie, some post it notes, and (potentially) some recycled materials.  "
Course Vision:  
Our Course (in a nutshell)  
"As of late, design thinking is everywhere… it is currently offered by PSU’s business school, the "
"school of Art and Design, and University Studies. You could say that design thinking is HOT or in "
"demand (whichever you prefer). As design thinking has risen i n popularity, many people have "
"differing opinions about it, but most seem to agree that design thinking is a set of tools and "
mindsets to creatively solve problems in new and meaningful ways.  
Course Goals  
"As members of this learning community, students wi ll "
● learn the basic tools and mindsets of Design Thinking and practice those tools in 
iterative cycles of design  
● become familiar with the process of design thinking as it pertains to community -
centered design  
"● identify processes, core concepts, and modes of  action and engagement relevant to the "
key issues through stepping into a human -centered design process  
"● use technology to mobilize, connect, and share information about community -based "
"themes, explore key issues related to community -based themes and ultima tely propose "
a community -centered design in response to key issues  
"Through the course goals and outcomes, students will engage deeply with learning in the four "
"key university studies areas: inquiry and critical thinking, communication, diversity of human  "
"experience, and ethics and social responsibility.  "
Course Outcomes  
"● Evaluate, analyze, and compare primary and secondary sources related to community -"
based themes. ( UNST Inquiry and Criti cal Thinking Goal ) 
● Make connections between course materials and hands -on experience collecting field research about community -based themes through a community -centered design 
process. ( UNST Inquiry and Critical Thinking and Diversity of Human Experience Goals ) 
"● Learn and use diverse forms of communication (blogging, email, oral presentations, and "
"reflective writing) to nurture relationships within small groups, with the community -"
"based th eme, and with the larger public. In -class workshops on these forms will be "
included. ( UNST Communication Goal ) 
"● Use empathy practices including sustained observation and deep listening to read, "
"interpret, and discuss/write reflectively to analyze bias and privilege. ( UNST Diversity of "
Human Experience and Ethics and Social Responsibility Goals ) 
● Analyze written and hands -on best practices in community - centered design to create a 
proposed design. ( UNST Inquiry and Critical Thinking and Ethics and Social Responsibility 
Goals ) 
"● To apply in -class and field -base d learning to empower the self, communities or others to "
"initiate new content, create new partnership possibilities and/or take ownership of "
specific aspects of the community -based themes. Evidence of this work will take place in 
PRAXIS journals and the cu lminating community -centered design assignment. ( UNST 
Communication and Ethics and Social Responsibility Goals ) 
Some Essential Course Questions:  
How is empathy and building an understan ding of multiple perspectives an integral part of 
design thinking?  
What types of communication are used in design thinking?  
Why are different forms of communication so vital to the design thinking process?  
Why is it important to dig into ethical questions when it comes to design?  
What does social responsibility look like when it comes to design and/or design thinking?  
How does stepping out of the classroom into the world uncover deeper truths/questions abou t 
a subject/idea?  
How is design thinking applicable to almost anything and everything?  
Course Assignments:  
COURSE LEARNING AND PARTICIPATION  
Weekly Engagement with Course Content (10%)  
You are required to read/watch/listen to weekly coursework. The content will be the 
"foundation for our weekly discussions, so the deeper you dive into the content, the more "
dynamic our discussions will be!  
Weekly participation in this course is essential.  This is not the kind of course that you can do 
fully on your own.  There are times when you will need feedback from peers in order to move 
"forward and you are expected to keep pace with the course, as a whole. Through course "
content we hope to grow our re lationship to ideas and information. Through weekly discussions 
we hope to cultivate community through conversations about our course content. This isn’t 
possible without you and your engagement.  
"Community Connection, Discussions & Reflections (20%)  "
Ever y week you will have 1 -2  reflections due.  Some of these reflections will be content -related 
(e.g. read this article and write a personal response about it) or process -related (e.g. having 
"completed your prototype, reflect on what was hard or easy for you  personally). Postings are "
due on Thursday of each week and you are expected to respond to two other students’ posts by 
the end of the week on Sunday.  
Small Group Meeting Attendance & Participation (20%)  
"During this asynchronous course, you will be require d to attend 3 virtual real time meetings "
with small groups.  You will have plenty of time to plan for this with your schedule and there 
will be a few different options for you to attend.  
Design Projects  (50% of final grade)  
"Over the course of this term, y ou will complete two design cycles.  The first will be a very small "
scale “rapid design cycle.” Your completion of the rapid cycle will account for 20% of this 
category.  The remaining 80% of this section of your grade will be evidenced in your weekly 
project deliverables starting at week 4. Each week you will submit smaller scaffolded 
"assignments which will include field research, a problem statement, 2 prototypes, testing data, "
"and, finally, a pitch presentation about your design concept.  "
Design Projects Weekly Outline:  
"● Week 1: Rapid Design Cycle: Intro, Intro to Rapid Design Cycle  "
"● Week 2: Rapid Design Cycle: Empathy, Define, Brainstorm  "
"● Week 3: Rapid Design Cycle: Prototype, Test, Share  ● Week 4: Community Design Project: Introduction  "
● Week 5:  Community Design Project: Interviews  
"● Week 6: Community Design Project: Synthesize, Define, Cause & Effect Mapping  "
● Week 7: Community Design Project: Prototype & Test  
● Week 8: Community Design Project: Iterate  & Develop  
● Week 9: Pitch Presentation Preparatio n 
● Week 10: Pitch Presentations & Responses Due  
Course Evaluation:  
Your evaluation is based on the learning demonstrated by your contributions to our mentored 
"weekly discussions, weekly reflection and community -centered design project.  "
"You will take part in a variety of evaluation methods: self -evaluation, peer evaluation, and "
instructor/mentor feedback.  
"If work is submitted below standard, it is possible you can get in touch in order to re -do the "
"assignment.  Communication is key, so  please don’t be shy about being in contact with the "
instructor and the mentor.  
Policies:  
Presence & Participation: Consistent weekly participation is expected and required. Lack of 
participation will impact your grade. Please know that we want you to be  successful and 
understand life can be unexpected. We will just expect regular communication about any 
problems that arise so that we can problem solve and adapt together.  
Late Work:  Late work will receive a small penalty that will increase for each day it is late.  
Please do your best to get things in on time.  If are able to check in ahead of time about an 
"assignment that you know will be late, it’s possible that the penalty will be waved.  "
"Plagiarism:   Utilizing AI to do your work is considered plagiarism. Please don’t do it.  In fact, "
"because of the nature of this course, AI is more likely to lead you astray than help you.  Trust "
"me, I’ve seen this in action!  Also, we do a lot of posting of our work fo r feedback from peers.  "
Please do not take things from other people.  It’s a very embarrassing situation to be caught 
doing this and I am required to report this sort of plagiarism to the office of student conduct 
and responsibility.  UNST 222A Week -by-Week  Course Map:

Course Description : This course will focus on the introduction of women’s studies and sexuality 
studies as an academic field of study. Goals for this course is to increase knowledge of the role of 
"gender in culture, the feminist response to these roles, development of the a bility to think "
critically on these issues and increase understanding for bringing about justice for the lives of 
historically underrepresented people in our culture. Additionally the goals of this course is to 
"have fun while we create a collaborative, inc lusive learning community, come to an "
"understanding of the history, theory and joy of feminism as a social justice movement and an "
ideology through critical analysis and advance academic excellence.  
Objectives:  
"•Develop critical thinking, reading, writing and computer skills  "
•Learn proper citation and writing skill  •Understand the basic principles of Feminism and its applications  
•To be able to analyze a diversity of perspectives as opposed to a monolithic or dichotomous 
perspective  
•To analyze power relations and develop an understanding of issues that make up the everyday 
lives of historically underrepresented people  
•Develop s kills to take action based on the principles you learn  
•To build a community of learners committed to helping one another through the learning 
process  
To bring about these goals it is important that we learn in community and that each member of 
the community assumes responsibility for their own judgments and learning within this 
community. This means coming to class prepared (having done all the readings ) ready to ask 
questions and respond to others questions and respecting one another with compassion for each 
other’s different perspectives.

ASSIGNMENTS  
REQUIRED ASSIGNMENTS   
Attendance and Participation:   
"All students are expected to participate in on line discussions, and other on line activities "
"assigned to the class. Each week we will have an activity and a set of readings to view, read, etc. "
"Your life experiences, your understanding of the world, the qu estions you raise are a "
fundamental part of the learning of this class. The most important learning you will do is from 
each other. Participation includes both posting and reading so please come to class having read 
"each week’s materials and ready to engag e in fun, healthy dialogue. Each missed post will result "
in a lower grade. Exceptions can be made due to illness and unexpected events but please contact 
"me BEFORE class that you will be missing a class (for example, attendance at sports teams, "
"work, etc).   "
Discussion:  The expectation of this course is for you to learn basic principles of critical thinking 
through a feminist perspective. Learning concepts of social construction as it relates to gender 
"race class sexuality, etc are very sensitive issues. Opp ressive language in discussions will not be "
"tolerated. Remember, everyone in this class will have their own unique experiences and feelings  "
about the material and we must be respectful of that even when we do not agree. If you feel that 
"you must interrupt someone else’s behavior that you perceive as oppressive, please remember "
that human beings are fallible. We are all learning and this class should be viewed as a learning opportunity for everyone and the utmost sensitivity should be used in addressing oppr ession  
Writing:  We will be doing a lot of writing in this class since you are NOT meeting face to face. 
Through free writing and reflection we will engage in private and public assignments to bring 
about an understanding of class materials and how they relate to your cor e values. We will probe 
deeply into your fundamental assumptions about the way the world works and to identify and 
think critically about your beliefs in relation to these issues. These writings will help you 
evaluate and manipulate ideas to clarify your t houghts in preparation for all class assignment 
papers  
You will be responsible for helping each other through the writing process. What this will look 
like is you will be providing feedback and helping to identify common writing concerns for each 
other. E ach week you will read a set of assigned readings and respond to them. Talk about why 
this is important. Place it within the context of social relations. Then you will comment on posts 
that others have made giving feedback on their analysis and writing. In  this way we will be 
creating a writing community where you all help each other. If writing is your strength you will 
use that skill to help others. And the other way round. There are discussion sections on Canvas 
where you make your posts. Each initial po st of your own paper is worth 1 point and your 
response to other peoples’ post will be worth 1 point. The due dates  are posted on each 
assignment in Canvas each week. They usually open on Monday at midnight and close on 
Sunday at 11:59pm.  
Writing Guidelin es for all posts   
Most posts have a word requirement of AT LEAST 300 -500 words of analysis. When in 
"doubt, please write for 300 -500 words. DO NOT CUT AND PASTE WITH MICROSOFT "
OFFICE WORKS. IT SCREWS UP THE FORMATTING

then give a short presentation to the rest of the class. Each group will then present to the rest of 
"the class the major themes of the book. Try to have fun in  your presentations, use music, videos, "
"theater, whatever you all can agree on that will help the rest of the class understand your book. These presentations will be all on -line so its up to y’all on how creative you want to be.  "
Each week you will post yo ur progress on the book in the Discussion section under “Book Logs” 
in the Mentor Session on Canvas. There you will log your activities for your group such as 
"“bought the book, had to go to 6 stores to find it blah blah blah, Week two read to page 97.” If "
you finish the book early you must still post to the book group logs. You can post ideas for your 
"presentation, themes in the book to discuss or help others who are having trouble  "
Each member in your group should post for the presentation. One person can post the powerpoint 
"presentation, youtube video or whatever product y’all came up with but you all need to post your "
own thoughts. I would like you to address:  
A brief summary of the book and the themes addressed in the book that correspond to the issues 
we discussed in class  
A critical response to the book. How did the author address the issues discussed in class? Why 
were these issues important (or not)? Was i t realistic? Was the author way off base? How do 
you think the story could have been written differently?  
A personal response to the book: Tell me about your personal connection to these issues. What 
themes did you connect with? Can you relate to any of t he characters in the book? Does it 
encourage you to read more books like this?  
BOOK GROUP Presentations will be given : during week 9. Your participation is worth 1 point 
for each member of the group. Each member of the group must make a post and then you will be 
evaluating each other’s presentation and will receive 1 point for every post to the other groups 
for a total o f 6 points.  
There are more detailed instructions for the book groups on Canvas  
FINAL   
"DUE DATE : Sunday March 17th, 11:59 pm posted to Canvas. I will give you one point for "
"your initial post or ""showing up"" and one point for responding to at least one other person's post  "
Do an outrageous act  
Do an activity that is somehow “outrageous” in terms of gender that you expect might lead to 
"“gender policing.” (That is, people expressing to you —verbally or through their actions —that they considered your activity gender inappropriate). Think about a social or personal problem "
related to gender that you would  like to see changed. Then think about something you can do to  
effectuate some change on this issue. Your actions must be new to you (please don’t ask to do an 
act based on something you did last summer) and the activity must be about gender/sexuality (I 
appreciate that you already do work outside of school volunteeri ng for animal rescue or helping 
the homeless or advocating for medical marijuana but this act is about gender/sexuality 
"specifically). It could be something that speaks to gender collectively, or it can be more personal. "
"Don’t hesitate to think of the act intersectionally, activities that fight racism, homophobia, "
"ageism, etc. interconnected with gender can qualify. You are free to do this in groups or as an "
"individual project. The outrageous act is being active, outside the classroom and possible raising "
"awareness of those around you. If you work in a group, be sure to use the talents of each group "
member effectively. One group member may be a good writer; another may be good at 
"convincing others to take actions, etc. If you do some kind of artwork don’t te ll me you’re a "
"terrible artist, Just do it! (But don’t hand in a picture drawn with a bic on lined paper either)  "
Some examples:  
*Don’t shave or use make up for a month  
"*Add up how much you spend on make up, pantyhose, dry cleaning, etc vs a male *Make "
cupcakes and sell them in the park blocks: Charge men $1 and women 75 cents to make a point 
about women making 75 cents to a man’s dollar  
*One student sold cupcakes she ma de with vaginas on them and donated the proceeds to a 
battered women’s shelter  
*A student with long hair cut it almost all off and donated the hair to an organization that helps 
people with cancer have wigs  
*Sit down with yer grandma (or elder woman in your life) and talk about they handled their 
period in the 30’s before tampons  
*Learn to knit and make re -usable tampons or pads for yourself or donate them to a country 
where girls don’t have any sanitary pro ducts and can’t go to school  
You will present your final project on Canvas to the rest of the class in its own Canvas thread 
during the last week of class. Please write for 300 -500 words and answer these questions: 1. Pre 
"act: What is your act? Why does t he problem addressed concern you? What do you plan to do? Why do you think your actions will help? What are your expectations? How did you feel, and "
what did you learn about yourself as you planned the act?  
2. Act: Describe the act. Your responses? Feelings?  
3. Post act: Did you learn anything about the value of gendered acts? Are you 
"encouraged or discouraged? If you acted in a group, how did that go?  "
You are required to do two things for this assignment: You will post in the discussion 
section your act to share with the rest of the class and you must respond to at least one 
project This project is worth 2 points (1 point for your initial post and 1 point for your 
response to someone else)  
Extra Credit   
Extra credit is not formulated into the regular grade system cuz it’s an option. It is not worth the  
usual one point per assignment.  If it were in the formula then those folx who chose to opt out 
would get dinged points. Does that make sense? I can’t put a  line item in the grades for extra 
credit because that would mean everyone is responsible for extra credit whether you did it or not. 
"So if you don't do it, the line item for extra credit will bring your grade down. So I am keeping "
track of any extra credi t you do and adding it into your final grade at the end of the term. So for 
"example, let’s say your final grade is teetering between 94 which is an A - and 95 which is an A. "
"If I see you’ve registered to vote, you posted a picture, responded to posts consis tently every "
week then I will totally move you up to an A. But if I see that you are not really participating in 
"class or just generally don’t seem to care then yeah, you’re getting an A  "
Here some ideas for extra credit  
"*Go to http://oregonvotes.org/  and register to vote, then when you receive your ballot in the mail "
turn it in. I will give you points for registering and points for actually voting. Please take a photo 
"or screen shot from registration website or scan an image of your ballots, registrati on as proof "
"(black out personal info like yer phone# or address). If you are not a US citizen, encourage "
someone who is to register and vote.  
*Read one of the books from another book group and write a 500 word review. All writing 
guidelines apply.  
*Got a n idea for extra credit? Let me know and we can discuss it  
Grading   The grades themselves (which are an average of Main session and Mentor session grades) are not 
exact numbers that add up to 100%. that’s why it’s an “A” RANGE or “B” RANGE etc. For 
"example, an A is within a low range of 64 -66 points for an A - up to the max imum points of 71 "
for an A+ (unless my math is wrong but this is all just to give you estimates it’s not an exact 
science).  
64-71 points = A range  
57-63 points = B range  
50-56 points = C range  
43-49 points = D range  
42 points and lower is failing  
These numbers may change as I add/delete assignments  
My two requirements for this class is to 1) show up and 2) do the work. If you do one 
but not the other you might be able to pass the class but you will not get an A. Please don’t tell 
me “I hope I will pass the class.” Tell me what work you have done and how you propose to get 
an A. Take responsibility for yourself. Your overall grade for the class will be determined by 
your participation. You can keep track of your grade on Canvas as we go along  
I will be posting your points on Canvas as you go so you can keep track of your points 
"yourselves. Please don’t ask me to keep track of your points for you,  it is very time consuming "
for me and you are big kids now and can take care of yourselves

Course
Description
This
course
focuses
on
working
to
understand
how
"history ,"
culture
and
geography
inform
the
present
situation
in
various
regions
of
the
world.
Students
explore
the
forces
of
tradition
and
"modernity ,"
"nationalism,"
colonialism
and
"empire,"
and
globalization
and
development.
Exploration
of
"perspectives,"
attitudes
and
beliefs
of
another
culture/region
informs
students
of
the
interconnectedness
of
human
experience
that
frames
contemporary
global
interactions.
This
course
is
designed
for
students
with
little
or
no
previous
study
"of,"
or
experience
living
in
dif ferent
regions
in
the
world.
The
course
is
also
suitable
as
a
‘stand-alone’
"course,"
either
for
those
interested
in
a
global
education
of
non-western
"societies,"
wishing
to
expand
their
knowledge
of
global
perspectives
beyond
their
area
of
specialization.
Content
and
Structure
The
course
is
intended
as
an
introduction
rather
than
as
a
"survey ,"
and
is
composed
of
a
broad
cultural-geographical
introduction
followed
by
weekly
modules
that
provide
a
series
of
pertinent
topics
that
examine
specific
themes
such
as
"music,"
"food,"
climate
change
and
human
traf ficking.
The
approach
is
multi-disciplinary
and
takes
the
historical
context
into
consideration.
Each
module
structures
with
a
core
text
including
readings
and
films.
Themes
A
number
of
themes
are
given
particular
emphasis
throughout
the
course:○
The
Impact
of
the
W est
through
colonization;
"economic,"
political
and
cultural
globalization
○
Cultural
traditions
that
have
shaped
and
continue
to
shape
cultural
identity
○
The
individual
and
society
Learning
Objectives
○
T o
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
multiple
regions
in
the
world
through
its
"culture,"
social
"dynamics,"
economic
partnerships
and
globalization
○
T o
become
a
global
citizen
with
a
deeper
understanding
of
intercultural
interactions
in
the
world
Canvas
as
our
LMS
This
course
uses
Canvas
as
the
main
learning
platform.
In
order
to
be
successful
in
this
"course,"
I
recommend
that
you
go
through
the
remote
readiness
course
provided
by
the
PSU
Learning
Center .
If
you
need
just
in
time
technical
"support,"
please
first
contact
the
OIT
helpdesk.
If
they
are
unable
to
assist
"you,"
please
let
me
know .
Expectations
for
an
Online
Course
The
online
format
is
a
relatively
new
form
of
university
learning
and
requires
discipline
to
succeed.
Students
should
be
self-motivated
and
comfortable
expressing
themselves
through
writing.
In
"addition,"
time
management
is
a
major
factor
in
online
success.
Students
should
follow
these
basic
rules
for
time
management:
○
At
the
start
of
the
"quarter ,"
login
to
"Canvas,"
go
through
the
syllabus
and
other
course
"materials,"
and
check
all
due
dates
and
deadlines
on
the
calendar .
Consider
setting
up
electronic
reminders
if
time
management
is
a
challenge
for
you.
○
Check
Canvas
announcements
DAIL Y .
I
post
regular
reminders
and
other
materials.
○
Block
out
time
for
your
online
class.
Set
personal
weekly
times
for
“attending”
your
online
"class,"
just
like
attending
a
campus
class.
Y ou
should
reserve
the
time
equivalent
to
that
time
you
would
spend
in
class
plus
the
study
time
outside
of
class.
○
"AL W A YS,"
start
on
your
work
early
in
case
of
a
computer
problem—don’t
wait
until
the
last
minute.

Response/Discussion
Post
Guidelines
(30%
of
final
grade)
Must
read
course
materials
before
embarking
on
an
analytical
response/discussion
post.
T o
aid
your
understanding
of
the
selected
"readings,"
to
share
with
"peers,"
and
to
improve
your
writing
"skills,"
1.
Y ou
need
to
include
identification
of
the
"argument(s),"
a
"thesis,"
and
the
readings’
contribution
to
International
and
Global
Studies.
Choose
one
reading
or
a
cluster
of
readings
from
the
week
you
are
posting
in.
2.
What
does
the
reading
say?
The
first
part
of
the
discussion
post
should
be
a
summary
of
the
arguments
of
the
"readings,"
not
a
general
summary .
This
should
be
approximately
4-5
sentences.
Y ou
will
be
graded
on
"conciseness,"
understanding
of
the
"text,"
and
the
quality
of
writing.
It
is
important
that
you
read
carefully
in
order
to
ensure
that
you
are
able
to
discern
and
include
the
most
important
arguments
from
the
readings
you
cover .
3.
Analysis
of
significance
of
reading
and
its
contribution
to
Global
Studies
:
The
second
section
of
the
post
should
be
an
analysis
of
the
significance
of
the
"readings,"
"both,"
to
everyday
life
and
to
theory
{based
upon
what
you
have
read
in
this
course}.
What
you
write
in
this
section
should
ef fectively
answer
thequestion
“Why
do
the
readings
matter?”
and
should
logically
follow
your
argument
and
analysis
in
the
preceding
section.
4.
Use
APA
(American
Psychological
Association
Style
Guide
or
Manual)
when
citing
in
the
text
and
adding
the
reference
at
the
end
of
your
discussion.
The
title
of
your
post
should
list
the
reading(s)
you
are
discussing
and
who
wrote
them.
Any
additional
source
of
information
in
your
writing
also
needs
to
be
added
using
"AP A,"
to
the
text
and
at
the
end
of
your
"post,"
in
a
References
or
Bibliography
section.
5.
Y ou
may
include
an
example
or
reference
from
the
films
or
popular
press
readings
linked
on
Canvas
if
they
are
connected
to
the
readings
as
well.
Film
or
newspaper
articles
may
not
be
critiqued
in
lieu
of
the
main
reading
list
for
the
week—find
a
way
to
connect
them
to
the
course
readings.
If
I
have
specifically
asked
you
to
critique
a
film
for
a
weekly
"module,"
then
follow
the
guidelines.
6.
Pose
at
least
one
conceptual
question
about
the
readings
and/or
topics
that
could
contribute
to
the
discussion
of
the
weekly
topic
at
"hand,"
or
extend
the
argument
proposed
in
the
reading
of
your
"choice,"
into
new
"terrain,"
or
connect
concepts
found
within
the
text
or
outside.
The
question(s)
will
be
graded
on
thoughtfulness
and
how
ef fective
a
tool
it
is
for
promoting
discussion.
7.
Y ou
are
required
to
“Reply”
or
respond
to
at
least
one
other
group
members’
post
to
earn
full
points.
Additional
Notes:
Late
work
will
be
graded
accordingly
.
Do
not
turn
in
more
than
one
post
for
a
week’ s
worth
of
readings.
Y ou
will
be
required
to
do
one
post
every
other
week.
Other
Class
Matters
This
is
a
course
that
requires
substantial
"reading,"
fit
for
a
sophomore
college
course
anywhere
in
the
country .
Make
sure
you
have
a
reading
discipline
and
complete
readings
before
you
start
writing
your
discussion
posts
or
taking
your
quiz.
Maintaining
notes
from
the
readings
will
help
too.
Notes
from
your
weekly
readings
are
highly
recommended.
Academic
Honesty
Plagiarism

Course
Description
This
course
is
a
Sophomore
Inquiry
course
designed
as
an
introduction
to
the
Global
Perspectives
Junior
Cluster.
We
will
focus
specifically
on
a
global
and
environmental
approach
to
human
"history,"
one
which:
"provincializes
Europe"
by
embracing
a
diversity
of
"perspectives,"
seeks
to
decolonize
our
"worldview,"
and
centers
the
systemic
injustices
that
create
global
inequities
and
have
launched
us
into
a
new
geologic
age.
*Note
that
this
is
an
abbreviated
version
of
the
"Syllabus,"
please
see
Canvas
for
the
full
Syllabus.Course
Objectives:
Students
in
the
Global
Perspectives
cluster
will:
1.
Analyze
the
notions
of
"modernity,"
"nationalism,"
colonialism
and
"empire,"
and
globalization.
2.
Demonstrate
understanding
of
perspectives
and
beliefs
of
cultures
in
various
regions
of
the
world.
3.
Appreciate
the
diversity
and
interconnectedness
of
the
human
experience
that
frames
contemporary
global
interactions.
4.
Become
aware
of
global
inequalities
and
global
responsibilities.
Reading
and
Texts
Knowledge
and
critical
thinking
are
gained
through
active
and
close
reading
of
both
a
variety
of
different
types
of
texts.
To
get
the
most
out
of
the
"class,"
you
should
complete
the
assigned
readings
and
watch/listen
to
the
audio/visual
materials
each
week.
All
materials
are
available
"at,"
no
additional
"cost,"
via
"Canvas,"
i.e.
there
are
no
required
texts
to
purchase
for
this
course.
Any
problems
accessing
the
reading
should
be
reported

25%*The
course
uses
a
Weighted
Grading
system.
This
means
that
all
assignments
are
not
equally
important
to
your
final
grade
(and
the
points
earned
by
each
assignment
are
not
an
indication
of
their
final
weight).
If
you
would
like
further
clarification
about
what
this
means
and
how
to
differentially
value
different
"assignments,"
please
do
not
hesitate
to
ask.
Reading
Annotations
The
Reading
Annotations
are
an
opportunity
to
engage
with
the
readings
and
your
peers
online
through
an
application
called
Hypothesis.
You
can
access
the
application
directly
through
the
assignments
on
Canvas.
If
you
encounter
any
difficulty
accessing
Hypothesis
or
using
the
"application,"
contact
me
and
I
can
provide
assistance.
In
addition
to
specific
"guidelines,"
you
are
encouraged
to
highlight
and
comment
upon
or
pose
questions
about
as
many
parts
of
the
readings
as
you
"like,"
and/or
the
comments
and
questions
posted
by
your
peers.
Online
Weekly
Journal
One
of
the
weekly
standing
assignments
is
to
post
to
your
online
writing
journal.
These
are
spaces
for
you
to
accomplish
what
we
often
call
"preliminary
writing"
connected
to
the
course.
Preliminary
writing
can
take
many
forms
but
is
often
focused
on
the
exploration
of
"ideas,"
"topics,"
or
themes.
It
represents
initial
thoughts
that
you
might
have
about
a
concept
or
piece
of
evidence
that
you
might
consider
exploring
later.
Essays
Two
short
essay
assignments
together
constitute
30%
of
your
final
grade.
These
more
formal
writing
assignments
provide
you
with
an
opportunity
to
examine
two
of
the
texts
that
we
will
read
as
part
of
this
course
"(Konadu's,"
"Naming
and
Framing
a
Crime
Against
Humanity,"
and
"Davis',"
"Victoria's
Ghosts)."
Additional
details
and
more
specific
guidance
can
be
found
in
the
Essays
Assignment
on
Canvas.
Culminating
Project
The
Culminating
Project
is
an
opportunity
for
you
to
explore
a
course-related
topic
or
theme
in
greater
depth.
You
are
welcome
to
pursue
any
topic
that
is
of
interest
to
"you,"
provided
that
it
relates
directly
to
the
overarching
themes
of
the
course.

*A
Note
Concerning
Due
Dates*
As
flexibility
around
due
dates
can
improve
chances
of
"success,"
there
is
some
flexibility
around
deadlines
in
this
class.
●
Reading
Annotations
will
only
be
accepted
for
full
credit
if
they
are
submitted
by
the
official
due
date
(by
main
session
each
Thursday)
●
Online
Writing
Journal
is
an
ongoing
assignment
throughout
the
term.
For
full
"credit,"
you
must
have
at
least
one
post
per
week.
●
Both
Essays
can
be
submitted
for
full
credit
within
two
weeks
following
the
official
due
date.
●
All
assignments
including
the
Final
Project
must
be
submitted
by
the
end
of
the
day
"Friday,"
3/22
Within
the
grace
"period,"
it
is
not
necessary
to
request
an
"extension,"
nor
should
you
feel
obligated
to
explain
or
justify
your
need
for
flexibility
and
additional
time
.
You
are
a
human
being
and
life
happens
and
your
intellectual
process
and
growth
as
a
scholar
may
at
times
require
some
additional
time
(unless
you
are
using
AI
to
complete
the
course
and
then
you
should
not
have
any
trouble
meeting
deadlines
and
your
work
will
be
oddly
disconnected
to
the
course
and
contain
inaccurate
citations
and
nonsensical
errors).
You
are
strongly
encouraged
to
submit
the
assignments
when
they
are
initially
due
"and,"
if
you
begin
to
fall
"behind,"
consult
with
me
to
devise
the
best
course
of
"action,"
as
not
all
assignments
are
equally
essential
to
your
success
in
the
course
and
I'm
happy
to
work
with
you
to
strategize.
Office
Hours
and

You
are
encouraged
to
consult
with
me
at
any

in
the

with
"problems,"
"concerns,"

about

course
in
general
and
your
progress
in
the
course
more
specifically.

A. COURSE OBJECTIVES  2 
 This Sophomore Inquiry course will examine the nature and state of healthy individuals in various environments. Topics will 
"focus on ways to solve and/or prevent issues that can negatively impact the health and wellbeing of individuals, their local "
"environ ment, and/or the global community.  "
This course uses a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework which means you will find multiple ways to acquire 
"information and knowledge, multiple means to show what you know, and multiple means of engagement. Upon completing "
"this course, you will be able to:  "
"• Think critically about how environmental factors (e.g. cultural, economic, and political) affect the health of a "
community.  
"• Understand and communicate basic concepts of health and community presented in quantitative, qualitative, "
and analytic formats.  
"• Find the commonalities and differences in the development, experiences, and opportunities present within "
diverse communities.  
"• Examine and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary "
settings from multiple perspectives.  
• Explore social justice and ethical responsibility as they relate to the health and wellbeing of one’s own 
community.  
B. COURSE MATERIALS  
There is no book to buy for this course. All assigned materials are available online or via Canvas. Course assignments and 
"activities include links to all required materials including articles, podcasts,  videos, online activities, websites, and blogs.  "

The Course  
" Every human endeavor, including the arts, science, and even the academic discipline "
"of history itself, is an object of historical inquiry. Each of us is both a part of histori cal "
"process and is an agent —in particular, a moral actor —in these processes. Throughout the "
"quarter we will think about the implications of our relationship to the past, past actors, and "
"the historical study in our own lives in our own day. To do this, the  course will cover three "
areas.  
 The first part of the course (weeks 1 to 4) explores the basic types of interpretation of 
"the past, generally considered. We begin by thinking about memory in our lives and then "
about remembering and forgetting in writing a bout history. We then turn to the two most 
common types of thinking about how to interpret our relation to the past. One is based on 
viewing the collection and interpretation of facts and data as true representations of the past. 
The other holds that truth  in history resides in the accounts of the past that we create.   
  The second part of the course (weeks 5 to 6) surveys the fundamental in philosophy of 
history as developed during its “canonical” period in the first half of the nineteenth century. 
These ide as shaped the modern world.  
 The third part of the course (weeks 7 to 10) is devoted to another form of philosophy 
"of history that interprets the past as the ethical ground of our relations to one another, rather "
"than as an account of the past. This is ext remely provocative, and it is challenging as well. It "
offers us a chance to think about what it means to be human and to live in responsibility to 
others in the light of our relationship through history to the whole of the rest of humankind. 
In the last we ek we will look at extending this approach to history to the non -human world  
 All these theories deeply concern how we understand the human relationship to loss 
and change and to the trans -generational community of humankind. Throughout the course 
we will consider the moral demands that the past does or does not make on us.  
 The term paper is your own historical study of an original source of knowledge about 
"the human past of your own choosing, as described below. It is a chance to make a bit of "
history you r own and to reflect on its relation to you and your relation to it. I encourage 
each of you to explore the subjects and inquiries that interests you individually through 
taking time to deliberate the ideas to be presented and through doing your research f or the 
term paper.  
" The classes will be informal lectures, prompted in part by questions you develop from "
"the readings, and discussion.  "
" Note, as explained below:  "
  This course does not use Canvas.  
  This classroom is screen -free. 
  The grading is guided s elf-grading.   
" Please visit me to discuss papers, readings, or anything else in conference hours or by "
appointment!  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Attendance  
 Please attend all class and all mentor sessions. Not merely attend: please pay attention 
through all class sessions. Extend attendance into attention; attendance is almost nothing 
"without attention. Your attention, your reflection and deliberation, and your participation —"
"aloud and silently, with the others a nd with me —is the  most important and worthwhile "
"thing you can do in this course. Much of the material concerns how to look at, listen to, "
observe and inquire into history —how to make history present to you and how you might be 
"present in history. Above al l, therefore, your attention and thoughtful presence are required.  "
 Please bring copies of the texts under discussion with you to each session.  This is part 
of attendance.   
  It will not be possible for you to get an A term grade if you miss more than three  (3) 
"class sessions (not counting the first session), barring exceptional circumstances. It will not "
be possible for you to get a term grade better than a C - if you miss more than five (5) class 
"sessions (not counting the first session), barring exceptiona l circumstances. Attendance at all "
of your mentor sessions is required on the same basis.  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Class discussions  
 This course will largely consist of class discussions mixed with informal le ctures. For 
"this purpose, please bring the texts we are to discuss to each session.  "
 Come to each class with questions about the texts. Speak up to ask about what you do 
"not understand, and what provokes you, and what agree and disagree about.  "
" Students pa rticipate in classes in all kinds of ways, sometimes just by listening "
"without speaking. Because of the nature of moral and ethical reflection, I wish to center this "
course more on discussion than on lecture. Please feel free to ask any question or to stat e any 
point of view.  Please practice the norms of courtesy to one another and tolerance for the 
opinions of others.  
" Many students are reluctant to speak in class, often for very good reason; "
consequently I do not like to call on students. But I do not kn ow which students are 
comfortable with being prompted and which are not. I will observe your wishes in this 
respect at all times.  
 You do not have to raise your hand to speak.  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
"Computers,  phones, and other devices.  "
" This is a screen -free classroom . The use of computers, phones, tablets, and other "
digital devices during main class sessions is not allowed except (a). in cases of requests for 
reasonable accommodation submitted through the Di sablity Resources Center or (b). upon 
application to me for consideration of circumstances justifying the necessity of using a 
"device. If you do have an individual need of a device, please just let me know.  "
" A phone call or message, of which you are notifi ed by vibration or a light signal, that "
requires immediate response is of course an exception to this rule. Please leave the classroom 
to respond. I leave this in your hands; no explanation will be necessary.   
"  The work in this course is chiefly close readi ng of texts and discussion, for which "
purpose printed (“hard”) copies are far and away better suited than electronic display.  Our 
work in class needs no simultaneous online research.  
 From long experience I earnestly advice you to take notes by hand rath er than to type 
"them. This enables better focus on the lecture and better participation in the discussion, and "
typing in notes at a later time gives you a chance to review them. If you have an individual 
"need of a device, please just let me know.  "
 Please bring the texts we are to discuss to each session.  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Grading  
 This is a self -graded course.  This means that the term grade in this course will be 
guided  by your evaluation of your own work. Your self -grading is a matter of being in good 
"conscience; thus, as an ethical matter, it is part of the course content.   "
" I will not gave grades on the three written assignments, but I will give substantial "
comments.    
 The grade you chose for the term will be your course grade under these three 
conditions:  
 1.  You cannot pass the course without satisfactorily completing all written 
assignments;  
 2.  You must meet the attendance requirements listed below; and  
 3.  I reserve the right to change insincere or egregiously wrong self -assigned grades.  
" In general, your and my final term grading for this course is qualitative rather than "
"quantitative. However, here is a rough quantitative guide that might be useful in your self-"
assessment for the term and in final course grading. Of 300 points:  
 Paper 1: 40 points  
 Paper 2: 40 points  
 Paper 3: 100 points (including topics list and research plan)  
 Main session participation: 50 points  
 Mentor session participation: 50 points  
 Final self -assessment: 20 points  
A = 300 –270; B = 270 –240; C = 240 –210; D = 210 –175; F = <175.  
"In cases of disagreement as to fair grading, we will rely on this quantitative approach.  "
Please note that course final term grading is qualitative as well as qu antitative.  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Papers  
  Completion of this course requires submission of all three papers.  
" Saving exceptional circumstances or unless other arrangements have been made, all "
"papers submitted from 1 to 48 hours late will be marked down 10%, all papers submitted up "
"to three (3) days late will be marked down 25%, and no paper will accepted more than  three  "
(3) days late. I will consider special arrangements. Please ask for such arrangements no later 
than 48 hours before any paper is due.  
 In all your papers please use just one serif text font in 12 -point size. Double -space the 
"main text. Do not bold  any words in the text; and reserve italics for foreign words, titles of "
"books or works of art, to mark the organization of the paper, or to help clarify difficult "
distinctions. Do not turn on right justification. The pages must be numbered and stapled.  
"Please put your name, the course number, and date in the upper left hand corner of the first "
"page.  Electronic copies of papers must be submitted in .doc, .docx, .wpd, or .pdf formats; no "
"other format will be accepted, and please do not send them as Googled ocs.  Please use Chicago "
Style for references.  
 Detailed guidelines for the close reading and term papers will be supplied on the dates 
listed in the course calendar below.  
 Please visit me to discuss papers in conference hours or by appointment!  
"Paper # 1, approximately 750 –1,250 words,  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Friday, February 16:  "
and 
"Paper #2, approximately 750 –1,250 words,  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Friday, March 8.  "
" Paper #1 must take its text from any one of the readings in sessions 3b to 6b, "
"inclusive. Paper #2 must take its text from any one of the readings in sessions 7b to 10b, "
"inclusive. Though paper #2 is due at the  end of week 9, you may use one of the readings from "
sessions10a and 10b.  
 For each paper give a close reading of a passage from one of the available readings.  
"The passage may be one sentence, several sentences, a paragraph or more; but it is to be no "
longer than one page of the text.  
" Close reading is a critical reflection on the logic, multiple meanings, and inferences in "
a text. The paper concerns your exploration of issues and possible approaches to questions 
rather than conclusions.  
 A guideline will  be distributed.  
"Paper #3 (term paper), approximately 2,500 –4,500 words,  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Tuesday, March 19.  "
" For the term paper, pick a manuscript, printed item, or image from the Yale ’s "
"digitized collections or from any other specified digital collection at Yale, relevant to any "
"field of historical inquiry, that was made at any time or in any place whatsoever prior to "
"1939 in any place and in any language. Carefully observe the object,  contextualize it, and  "
" develop a point of view about it. Your paper should describe the object, state a point of view, "
"defend it by reference to internal and external evidence, and consider other answers. Your "
"point of view may concern anything from its cr eation, manufacture, or circulation, to the "
"information the object gives us on an historical matter, or to the means and impact of its "
diffusion.   
" The list of possible research topics with live links is due by email by 8pm Friday, "
January 26.  This is who lly preliminary and commits you to none if the topics listed. It is to be 
submitted to me with live links to the Beinecke Library or other Yale collection pages for the 
primary sources you are considering for your term paper. This is an informal document.  
" The research plan  with live links is due by email by 8pm Friday, February 7.  This "
includes your final topic and ideas for researching it. This is an informal document. If I do 
"not approve the research plan, you must re -submit it. Discuss it with me before  or after class, "
"in regular office hours, by appointment, or (as a last resort) by email.  "
 A guideline will be distributed.  
 Please feel free to consult me at any stage of research for this paper.  
"Final self -assessment, approximately 150 –500 words (1 –2 pages),  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Thursday, June 15.  "
 Grade yourself on the letter -grade according to your conscience and in accord with

Plagiarism  
" Plagiarism, intentional or unintentional, is pointless and intolerable. Plagiarism is the "
use of the work of others falsely presented as your own work. It includes work submitted for 
"other courses and turned into me as original, and it also includes paraph rases from works not "
cited as sources. Detecting plagiarism has become extremely easy. Papers that can be shown 
to have been plagiarized will automatically receive an “F” grade. Students who submitted 
such papers will either fail the course or will be requ ired to resubmit their papers and will be 
deducted in their grade an amount appropriate to the late paper policy given in the 
assignment guidelines. At my discretion. I will ask students who have plagiarized to submit 
"new, original work in order to pass th e class. Repeated or particularly egregious offenses may "
be cause for severe administrative  action.  
Plagiarism includes any use of text taken from an LLM such as Chatgpt and any other AI -
generated source.

The Course  
 The heart of this course is reflection on our sources of moral and ethical values. This 
includes exploring the authority of our sources and the warrant by which we make 
"judgments. Also, this requires that we evaluate how we think abou t these matters to "
"understand what, if anything, makes for valid moral reasoning, feeling, and knowledge. All "
"these elements together comprise our moral lives, and our approach to these issues becomes "
our moral vision.  
 The course begins with framing the c ore questions and then moves first to some 
doubts about the truthfulness of value judgments and then to two of the major arguments for 
such judgments. In the second half of the quarter we look at various accounts of the source of 
"morality: divine judgment,  individual conscience, political context, and mystical or non -"
rational illumination.  
 I have carefully chosen readings from major philosophers and several important films 
that help illuminate these questions. All of the readings are primary sources: they deserve  
 2 
"your most careful consideration. Though not long, they are demanding. My experience has "
"been that the best way to read such texts is a quick preview followed by unhurried reading, "
and then a second or even a third reading with a day or two break in -between. It helps a 
great deal to have quiet in order to concentrate: headphones may be your best friend for this 
purpose.  
 We live in times and in a country that demands serious deliberation about our own 
moral responsibility and civic obligations. Three main class sessions are scheduled as “open / 
"current events.” They are open for further discussion of issues raised in previ ous sessions, or "
"for new issues and questions, or for moral problems raised by current political and social "
events. I will pick a reading on current affairs that has recently been published for at least 
some of these open sessions; I’ll email this to you a  week or so ahead.   
" The classes will be discussion, supplemented by informal lectures. Your participation "
"in the discussions is vital to the course. To learn the most from this course, please read all "
"texts before class meets and bring printed copies of the texts to class, and please watch the "
movies before class meets.  
 In this course I use the word “ethics”and “morality to mean the same thing. Some 
"people draw sharp distinctions between the ethical and the moral, but I will not do so, just as "
a matter o f convenience.  
" Note, as explained beloew:  "
  This course does not use Canvas.  
  This classroom is screen -free. 
  The grading is guided self -grading.  
" Please visit me to discuss readings, papers, or anything else in office hours or by "
appointment!  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Attendance  
 Please attend all class and all mentor sessions. Not merely attend: please pay attention 
through all class sessions. Extend attendance into attention; attendance is almost nothing 
"without attention. Your attention, your reflection and deliberation, and you r participation —"
"aloud and silently, with the others and with me —is the  most important and worthwhile "
thing you can do in this course.  
 Please bring copies of the texts under discussion with you to each session.  This is part of 
attendance.  
 It will not b e possible for you to get an A term grade if you miss more than three (3) 
"class sessions (not counting the first session), barring exceptional circumstances. It will not be  "
 3 
possible for you to get a term grade better than a C - if you miss more than five (5 ) class 
"sessions (not counting the first session), barring exceptional circumstances. Attendance at all "
of your mentor sessions is required on the same basis.  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Class discussions  
 This co urse will largely consist of class discussions mixed with informal lectures. For 
"this purpose, please bring the texts we are to discuss to each session.  "
 Come to each class with questions about the texts. Speak up to ask about what you do 
"not understand, a nd what provokes you, and what agree and disagree about.  "
" Students participate in classes in all kinds of ways, sometimes just by listening without  "
"speaking. Because of the nature of moral and ethical reflection, I wish to center this course "
more on discus sion than on lecture. Please feel free to ask any question or to state any point of 
view. Please practice the norms of courtesy to one another and tolerance for the opinions of 
others.  
" Many students are reluctant to speak in class, often for very good rea son; consequently "
I do not like to call on students. But I do not know which students are comfortable with being 
prompted and which are not. I will observe your wishes in this respect at all times.  
 You do not have to raise your hand to speak.  
++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
"Computers, phones, and other devices.  "
" This is a screen -free classroom . The use of computers, phones, tablets, and other digital "
devices during main class sessions is not allowed except (a). in cas es of requests for reasonable 
accommodation submitted through the Disablity Resources Center or (b). upon application to 
me for consideration of circumstances justifying the necessity of using a device. If you do have 
"an individual need of a device, please  just let me know.  "
" A phone call or message, of which you are notified by vibration or a light signal, that "
requires immediate response is of course an exception to this rule. Please leave the classroom 
to respond. I leave this in your hands; no explanatio n will be necessary.  
" The work in this course is chiefly close reading of texts and discussion, for which  "
 4 
purpose printed (“hard”) copies are far and away better suited than electronic display.  Our 
work in class needs no simultaneous online research.  
 From long experience I earnestly advise you to take notes by hand rather than to type 
"them. This enables better focus on the lecture and better participation in the discussion, and "
typing in notes at a later time gives you a chance to review them. If you hav e an individual 
"need of a device, please just let me know.  "
 Please bring the texts we are to discuss to each session.  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Grading  
 This is a self -graded course.  This means that the term grade in this course will be 
guided  by your evaluation of your own work. Your self -grading is a matter of being in good 
"conscience; thus, as an ethical matter, it is part of the course content.   "
" I will not gave grades on the th ree written assignments, but I will give substantial "
comments.   
 The grade you chose for the term will be your course grade under these three 
conditions:  
 1.  You cannot pass the course without satisfactorily completing all written 
assignments;  
 2.  You must meet the attendance requirements listed below; and  
 3.  I reserve the right to change insincere or egregiously wrong self -assigned grades.  
" In general, your and my final term grading for this course is qualitative rather than "
"quantitative. However, here is a rough quantitative guide that might be useful in your self -"
assessment for the term and in final course grading. Of 300 points:  
 Paper 1: 15% of the term grade  
 Paper 2: 15% of the term grade  
 Paper 3: 20% of the term grade  
 Main session attendanc e and participation: 30% of the term grade  
 Mentor session attendance and participation: 20% of the term grade  
A = 100 –91; B = 90 –80; C = 79 –70; D = 69 –60; F = <60.  
"In cases of disagreement as to fair grading, we will rely on this quantitative approach.  "

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
Papers  
 Completion of this course requires submission of all three papers.  
" Saving exceptional circumstances or unless other arrangements have been made, all "
"papers submitted from 1 to 48 hours late will be marked down 10%, all papers submitted up "
"to three (3) days late will be marked down 25%, and no paper will accepted more than three  "
(3) days late. I will consider special arrangements. Please ask for such arrangements no later 
than 48 h ours before any paper is due.  
 In all your papers please use just one serif text font in 12 -point size. Double -space the 
"main text. Do not bold any words in the text; and reserve italics for foreign words, titles of "
"books or works of art, to mark the orga nization of the paper, or to help clarify difficult "
distinctions. Do not turn on right justification. The pages must be numbered and stapled.  
"Please put your name, the course number, and date in the upper left hand corner of the first "
"page.  Electronic co pies of papers must be submitted in .doc, .docx, .wpd, or .pdf formats; no "
"other format will be accepted, and please do not send them as Googledocs .  Please use Chicago "
Style for references.  
 Detailed guidelines for the close reading and term papers will be supplied on the dates 
listed in the course calendar below.  
 Please visit me to discuss papers in conference hours or by appointment!  
"Paper #1, approximately 750 –1,250 words (3 –5 pages),  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Friday, February 2 . "
and 
"Paper #2, approximately 750 –1,250 words (3 –5 pages),  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Friday, March 2.  "
" Paper #1 must take its text from any one of the  readings in sessions 1b to 4a, inclusive.  "
"Paper #2 must take its text from any one of the readings in sessions 6a to 9b, inclusive.  "
 For each paper give a close reading of a passage from one of the available readings.  
"The passage may be one sentence, se veral sentences, a paragraph or more; but it is to be no "
longer than one page of the text.  
" Close reading is a critical reflection on the logic, multiple meanings, and inferences in "
a text.  The paper concerns your exploration of issues and possible appro aches to questions 
rather than conclusions.  
 A guideline for papers #1 and #2 will be provided.  
 6 
"Paper #3, approximately 1,250 –1,750 words (5 –7 pages),  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Tuesday, March 19 . "
 In this paper discuss a moral quandary of your choice in terms of the approaches to the 
"source of moral truth discussed by the readings in sessions 6a to 9b inclusive (divinity, the "
"individual, and society) and/or presented in any one of the three assig ned films.  "
 Please feel free to consult me at any stage of work on these papers.  
"Final self -assessment, approximately 250 –500 words (1 –2 pages),  "
"due by email to me at bbg2@pdx.edu  by midnight on Thursday, March 21.  "
" Grade yourself on the letter -grade according to your conscience, and explain to me on "
"what principle(s) of conscience you chose the action you take, including how you conceive of "
right and wrong (or good and bad) in grading yourself; what principles of respon sibility to 
"yourself, to others, and/or to divinity you hold to, if any; and in what way, if any, these "
principles requires honesty.

Plagiarism  
" Plagiarism, intentional or unintentional, is pointless and intolerable. Plagiarism is the "
use of the work of others falsely presented as your own  work. It includes work submitted for 
"other courses and turned into me as original, and it also includes paraphrases from works not "
cited as sources. Detecting plagiarism has become extremely easy. Papers that can be shown to 
have been plagiarized will aut omatically receive an “F” grade. Students who submitted such 
papers will either fail the course or will be required to resubmit their papers and will be 
deducted in their grade an amount appropriate to the late paper policy given in the 
assignment guidelin es. At my discretion. I will ask students who have plagiarized to submit 
"new, original work in order to pass the class. I will ask students who have plagiarized to "
"submit new, original work in order to pass the class.  Repeated or particularly egregious "
offenses may be cause for severe administrative action.

Mentor:  Adoria Walker

"Format   This is a fully online course.  It consists of ten weekly modules, as described below. "
Each module is available through the Canvas shell for this course.  
"Text    The Fundamentals of Ethics  (sixth edition), by Shafer -Landau, Oxford University Press , "
2024. This text is available in paper form and in electronic form for a lower price.  
Course Description    
 This course is an introduction to the philosophical treatment of ethics.  What makes right 
actions right?  Is there a rule we must always follow?  W hat might that be?  Or are there several 
"rules?  If so, how do we decide which one takes priority when they conflict?  In evaluating "
"actions, should we focus on the intentions of the agent, or is it the consequences of an action "
"that are decisive in assign ing praise and blame to the one responsible?  Or then again, is it a "
"mistake to concern ourselves solely with rules, to the exclusion of considerations of virtue and "
"vice?  In the end, I’ll suggest that a theory of obligation is incomplete without an accou nt of the "
virtues and that a virtue -based conception of ethics is deficient without rules for deciding 
between right and wrong.   
Course Requirements             
"1. Quizzes   (go to ‘Modules’ on the Canvas shell, and look under the ‘Weekly To -Do List’ "
in the  ‘Overview’ tab)  
"There are 9 quizzes, covering Modules 1 -9 . You are required to complete them all.  These are "
due by Sunday  of that week  at 11:59pm.                                                 
"(These are worth 5 points each, for a total of 45 % of the course grade. ) "
2. Initial Write -ups (go to ‘Assignments’ folder on Canvas)  
"There are write -up topics for Modules 1 -9, and you submit yours into the ‘Assignments’ folder. "
These are due by Thursday at 5:00pm.  These should be about 400 words in length (you can 
go longer if you see fit).   You have to do five of these over the term . They’re worth 5 points 
"each, for a total of 25 % of the course grade.   "
Upload a word document into the assignments folder of the Canvas shell under the ‘Write -
up Initial Submission’ tab.  
"Explain what you think is the best answer to the question or solution to the quandary posed, and "
"why you think so.  Spell it out a little: w hat is your answer, and how do you justify it?   "
" Please number your answer  (or paste the question it into the write -up), so that it is clear what "
topic you are addressing.  Please don’t just provide superficial answers to several of that 
module’s question s; stick to one of them and do your best with it.   If there are separate parts to 
"the topic, then letter them and answer them separately .   "
"At the end of your written response to one of that week’s prompts, pose a thoughtful question "
which either prompts further inquiry or challenges the position you took in the write -up you are 
posting.  Put it in bold so others can see it distinctly.   Part of your grade is determined by 
"whether you ask a good question --a thoughtful, probing challenge you make to yourself  and "
"others.  This is your class, and part of it is having an opportunity to see what your fellow "
"students are wondering about, and how they respond to what you’re thinking.   "
Note: It’s also important that you either attach or paste your write -up to the 
corresponding week’s ‘Discussion’ folder .  These will be the basis for students to respond to 
an initial write -up from another student . 
These writing assignments (‘write -ups’ or ‘initial posts’)  will be scored as follows:  
0—nothing submitted  
"1 or 2—you t urned something in, but it’s not a serious effort.  Approximate grade: C-/D "
3—you make some sense; decent work but not an inspired response.  Or else: your submission 
"needs editing (proofreading, punctuation, grammar). Approximate grade: C  "
"4: your response  is coherent, grammatical, and answers the question; pretty good job. "
Approximate grade: B  
5: thoughtful and well -written —very good work. Grade: A  
3. Discussion Posts     
"As you saw above, you also need to attach or paste your initial write -up to the Discus sion "
"folder.  That way, it will be available for other students to see and (if they so choose) to respond "
to in their discussion post.  Your own discussion post is thus a reply to an initial post (or write -
up) submitted by a fellow student .  Your response is due by Sunday at 11:59pm  (in other 
"words, the very end of the week).    At least 200 words.  These will be scored as completed or "
"not completed, not on a point -basis.  These are worth 3 points each , and you need to do five "
"total, for 15% of the course grade.  You can attach a word document to the discussion folder, or "
"paste it in, or else just type your response into the folder —whatever you like.    "
4. Course Reflections    (see Assignments Folder in Canvas). Worth 15% of course gra de. 
What are two different moral issues  that the material in this course has allowed (compelled?) 
you to think more deeply about?  Choose both: 
"[A]  a subject about which you hold (roughly) the same belief  which you did before the class, "
"but which you now  reason about differently than before .  In other words, you have come to a "
"conclusion that you already believed to be true, but you now support that belief differently.  "
Carefully e xplain your reasoning process . 
" [B]  a subject about which you have changed  your mind .  What did you use to believe, and why "
do you think differently than before?  Explain the process of rational deliberation  (or moral 
"deliberation, if you prefer) that you underwent in changing your mind.  "
Note: Do not just narrate your ‘experien ce’ or describe your ‘journey’.  And there’s no need to 
recount the course material (except as it helps you answer the questions)  Rather: describe or 
explain the process by which you reasoned your way to the conclusions you arrived at.  Due 
"Sunday, March  17 by midnight.  "
Outline of Course  Modules  
"All references are to The Fundamentals of Ethics  (sixth edition), by Shafer -Landau, Oxford "
"University Press , 2024 "
Module 1: Introduction (reading: Introduction)  
"We’ll begin  this term , in Module 1, with an introduction  to the discipline.  We’ll pay special "
"attention to how moral reasoning is supposed to work, so that we have the skills to understand "
"and assess the theories we’ll study.  There will be some technical terms introduced as well, so "
that we have a  common vocabulary for some of what is to come.  
"We’ll introduce the subject -matter, which is the philosophical treatment of ethics.  We’ll also "
consider some features of moral argumentation.  
"Module 2:  Relativism, Objectivism, and Moral Knowledge (readin g: Chapters 19, 21, & "
22) 
We’ll look at considerations about the status of ethics and whether we can have knowledge of 
right and wrong.  We’ll discuss cultural relativism  (the theory that moral judgments are always 
"and only indexed to a specific society o r civilization, and not to a standard which holds across "
"cultures and through history) .  We’ll also discuss subjectivism , the theory that pronouncements "
of right and wrong are merely expressions of the feelings and attitudes of the speaker (and are 
"ipso fa cto true, provided that the individual is being sincere) .  Should we be skeptical of the "
whole enterprise of ethical deliberation?  Or might there be objective standards of right and 
wrong?  
"Module 3: Egoism, Psychological and Ethical (reading: chapters 7  & 8)  "
"In this module, we will look at two very different theories, psychological egoism and ethical "
egoism. Psychological egoism  is the descriptive and explanatory theory that people cannot help 
but act in their own self -interest (thereby sharply restrict ing what is possible for people to do 
and making a mockery of our ordinary expectations and assessments of one another).  It’s a 
"serious challenge to what we are up to this term, so we need to address it.  Ethical egoism , "
"meanwhile, is the normative theory according to which one should act in one’s self -interest.  "
We’ll see whether it makes sense.  Module 4: Pleasure and Happiness (reading: Chapter s 1 & 2)  
What has value?  What has moral worth?  What kind of thing is suitable for moral beings to 
"pursue?  Hedonism  says that pleasure is the good, the thing to aim for in living a moral life.  "
We’ll look at some merits and difficulties with this theory of value.  
Module 5:  Does Morality Depend on Religion? (reading: Chapter 5)  
"In this week’s material , we will look at theocentric ethics, specifically the Divine Command "
"Theory of Morality   If someone says that right and wrong are determined by the will of God, "
what assumptions are being made?  And what further questions or dilemm as does that account 
of morality raise?   
Module 6:  Consequentialism and Utilitarianism (readings: Chapters 9 & 10)  
"This week, we’ll consider Consequentialism  (that the right thing to do is to bring about good "
"consequences),   and especially the most the  prominent sort of consequentialist theory, "
Utilitarianism  (according to which the right thing to do is to maximize happiness).  How is that 
"supposed to work as a moral theory, and what objections are there to utilitarianism?   "
Module 7:  Kantian Absolut ism (readings: Chapters  11 & 12)  
"In this module, we’ll turn our attention to the moral theory of Immanuel Kant , which can "
fruitfully thought of as a response to the objections against utilitarianism and some concerns 
about theocentric ethics.  Kant believ es that there are absolute moral rules which shouldn’t be 
"broken, and he thinks these can be generated from human reason.  "
Module 8:   Social Contract Theory (reading: Chapters 13 & 14)  
"To begin, we’ll consider some difficulties encountered with Ethical Egoism  (in Module 3), "
which  prompts an attempt to construe morality as the constrained maximization of self -interest.  
This is known as the Social Contract Theory of Morality —our subject for this module.  Might 
morality be construed as a form of rational or prudent fulfillment of self -interest?  
Module 9:   Virtue Ethics (readings: Chapters 17 & 18)  
"In this module, we’ll turn our attention to a different approach to conduct known as Virtue "
"Ethics .  Here, we ask a different sort of question than was promin ent in the normative theories "
"we will have looked at in modules 4 -8.  All along, we’ll have been asking something like: what "
rules should I follow?   But virtue ethics asks instead: what kind of person should I be?  By 
"looking at the virtue ethics approach , we are able to see some of the strengths and deficiencies "
of rule -based theories of morality.

Course Description  
This course will provide a foundation of leadership theory  and will examine models of 
leadership in relation to the theory and concepts of social  change.   There will be opportunities 
"for practice, application, and documentation of leadership, and reflection on individual "
responsibility for and potential in leadership roles. This SINQ leads to the Leading Social 
Change Cluster that explores theoreti cal frameworks of leadership studies across academic 
"disciplines, preparing students to understand the different forms leadership takes and grapple "
with the fundamental question of what it means to be a leader.  
Objectives  
Leading Social Change is designed  to support the University Studies objectives.  By the end of 
"this course, students should be able to:  "
"● Describe and analyze the leadership theories and models, and apply leadership "
"concepts to historical, current, and personal contexts;  "
"● Describe and analyz e the components, advantages and challenges of working in "
groups;  
● Explain and justify social perspectives different from their own;  
● Describe social and political mechanisms for moving social change and critically 
evaluate their personal role in social and political structures  
"● Synthesize concepts of leadership, collaboration, civic engagement, and social justice, "
and develop a plan to respond to a community need.  
University Studies Goals  
● Inquiry and Critical Thinking :  Students will learn various modes of  inquiry 
"through interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, "
"conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
● Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various 
"ways —writing, graph ics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate "
"effectively with others in group work, and to increase competency in appropriate "
communication technologies.  ● The Diversity of Human Experience :  Students will enhance their appreciation for 
and understanding of the rich complexity of the human experience through the study 
"of differences in ethnic and cultural perspectives, class, race, gender, sexual "
"orientation, and ability.  "
● Ethics and Social Responsibility :  Students will expand their understan ding of the 
"impact and value of individuals and their choices on society, both intellectually and "
"socially, through group projects and collaboration in learning communities.  "
Course Requirements & Evaluation  
Students are expected to complete all requirements for the course.  Grades are assigned based on 
points earned for each assignment.  Details about expectations and evaluation of specific 
assignments will be  included in the handouts in Canvas . Never rely on  the short description 
"in the syllabus to complete an assignment, there will always be a detailed handout.  "
Course Format and Requirements  
"This class will include group discussio ns, class activities, and work based on required readings.  "
"It is essential that students complete reading assignments prior to coming to class, so that they "
"can benefit from and engage in discussions.  In general, students should plan on spending about "
two hours of class preparati on outside  of class for each hour in class: about 4 -6 hours per week. 
"If you need assistance with the writing assignments, please contact the course mentor or "
professor in advance.

"prepared in an approved citation format (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.), including proper citations "
and references.  Documents should be prepared and submitted in a standard word pr ocessing 
format as a .doc file. NO PDFS will be accepted.  Please contact The Writing Center if you

Assignments/Grade Criteria:  
Attendance and Participation (4 0%) This class is designed for students to learn from one 
"another. This class is NOT lecture based, but instead relies heavily on stud ent participation and "
"discussion . Thus, participation is  mandatory. Students must read all assigned materials in "
"advance of class meetings and come p repared to discuss the assigned materials, insights from "
"other resources, and personal reflections. Attendance and participation are graded for main and "
mentor session and make up 4 0% of the overall grade. Students who miss two or more weeks 
should conside r dropping the course. Mentor session discussions are also a required part of 
participation.  
It is important to check in to the class at least 2 -3 times per week. The purpose of an online 
"discussion is to exchange ideas and to work as a group to explore n ew concepts. Consequently, a "
late posting does not provide an opportunity for exchange or feedback.  
Each discussion post should be approximately one double spaced page of text with 
appropriate references to the readings. This should be approximately 3 -4 paragraphs or 
"500-750 words.  In addition, responding to another student should include more than an "
agreement or one sentence response. Refer back to the text and ask questions that will encourage 
a dialog to ensure a rich discussion and learning environmen t. Your first discussion post is due 
"Thursday  each week, and your second response engaging other classmates posts are due by 11:59 Sunday evening every week. You must complete all readings before doing the discussion "
posts. You will not receive full credit  for posts if you do not post on other posts.   
Personal Item Share  and Autobiography Questions (7 %) Students will share with the class 
"something important to you related to your culture, family, and interests as it might relate to: "
"social change and/or issues in your community, city, country, etc. Bring in some sort of physical "
"representation (picture, i tem, drawing, etc.) that represents something important to you about "
"your culture, family, passion, life, and/or history. Something that holds a STORY that you can "
share with us. Each person will post a 2 minute video  to share about the item. Along with th is 
"assignment, you will be asked to submit responses to several questions that address your "
"autobiographical story. These questions ask you to reflect on how you have become who you are, "
"and should be an analytical and reflective review of the influences, factors, and traits that shape "
who you are. Detailed instructions will be given.  Please refer to handout for more information 
regarding what questions to answer.  Watching and responding to two other student videos is 
required.  
Social Change Media Gallery ( 7%): In Week 4 students will work independently to find real -
life examples of social change in our community and the world. Read your local and/or campus 
paper to identify social change. I can also suggest alternative media sources for social change 
exampl es outside of the mainstream media. Students will  summarize the example in your own 
words  (approximately 3 -4 paragraphs or 500 -750 words) then provide a viewing link for your 
classmates . Be prepared to answer the questions: What makes this social change? How did 
"people make change, or intend to make change? Who is affected by the change being made? Is it "
the ones creating the change or others? Do you think the change that is being made is positive or 
negative? What are some of the potential pitfalls that m ight be created from this change?  
Watching and responding to two other student videos is required.  
"Leadership in Your Major Annotated Bibliography  (15%)  For this assignment, you will "
prepare a 1 -2 page  annotated bibliography on leadership in your major or field of interest 
followed by answering some questions about the articles (also 1 -2 pages).  To do this you will 
locate three peer reviewed journal articles of your choice from the library website and annotate 
"them. You must read these three articles in entirety, reflect critically on them, and summarize "
them concisely in your own words . Annotated bibliographies that copy or paraphrase the article 
abstracts will not be accepted and result in an automati c failing grade.  You will also answer 
some questions about the three articles comparing and contrasting them. The assignment should 
be 1-2 page of citations and annotations followed by a short response (1 -2 pages) to the posed 
questions. PLEASE SEE ASSIGN MENT GUIDE IN CANVAS for full details about what is 
expected of you. Due Week 7.  
Community  Based Learning  Leadership Interview (Paper and Presentation) (25%)  
This course has a community -based  learning component and  CBL courses encourage students to 
apply theories and classroom learning to real -world situations that impact communities. CBL courses acknowledge that insights and understandings about key course themes are located in 
"multiple places, including in students ’ life experiences, the classroom, and the community. To "
"help synthesize course material on leadership and social change concepts, students will select 1 -2 "
organizations leading a social change effort locally that you are interested in. For example: 
"housel essness, poverty, black lives matter, community development, food security, immigrants "
"rights, etc. You will contact one leader and one volunteer in the organization and conduct 20 -30 "
minute interviews with them over Zoom for a total of two interviews. You  will be given an 
interview guide to facilitate your dialogue with your chosen leader in interviews and these should 
"be recorded. Following the interview, students will also be required to thank your interviewees in "
"writing.  Details on this assignment wil l be given soon. In CBL courses, students formally "
"represent the university, the instructor, the host community partners, and themselves both inside "
and outside the classroom. Professional behavior is expected at all times . This paper and 
presentation are due in Week 10.  
"Final Exam/Reflection Essay (6 %): In Week 1 0, you will submit  a critical reflection on your "
"interaction with the course content, including assessment, analysis, and reflection on course "
readings. It is important to keep up with readings throughout the term.  
Rules and Resources  
General Conduct and Maintaining a Resp ectful Learning Environment  
We will do our best to cultivate an online class atmosphere that is based on mutual respect. 
"During discussions, you may read statements, opinions, and arguments that vary significantly "
from your own ideas. It is important to remember that students in this course come from diverse 
backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of perspectives. It is not necessary that you like 
"other people’s opinions, only that you engage them with utmost respect. To this end, we will not "
"tolerat e rudeness, or personal attacks (which should not be confused with serious and meaningful "
"debate and discussion).  While it is rare that students behave in these ways, if any such tensions "
arise your mentor and I will be responsible.  
Plagiarism:  I expect th at ALL the writing you do for this course will be your own work. You 
"violate this ethic if you use the ideas, words, quotes, expressions or phrases without giving "
proper credit to the original source by using a citation (footnote or in -text). Plagiarism wi ll result 
in a zero grade for the assignment and lead to more severe academic consequences. A second 
"offence will earn you a failing grade for the class. If something is questionable, ask me for "
clarification.  
"Respect and Civility .  Ideas, not individuals,  are open to challenge.  The rich nature of the "
discussions is likely to raise opposing points of view.  You should feel comfortable being your 
"own advocate concerning the ideas and thinking of others, though that challenge cannot disparage the personal vi ews of your colleagues.  Individuals and individual perspectives will be "
treated with respect in order to facilitate a safe and civil learning environment for all.  
"Students are asked to pay attention to both the intent and the effect of their words, and to  avoid "
"deliberately using language that is demeaning to others.  In addition, when listening to others, "
mindfully assess both the intent and the affect/emotional tones of their words before assuming an 
offensive intent.  
"Respect and civility is the standard  for all communications in this class, including class "
"discussions, mentor sessions, online discussion on D2L, papers, e -mails, and group projects.   "
"Any papers using oppressive language (sexist, racist, homophobic or otherwise "
inappropriate expressions) wi ll be given back for revision and result in a lower grade.  
"Confidentiality :  In respecting the experiences of yourself and others, and creating a safe "
"environment, students should maintain confidentiality at all times.  Students’ own experiences "
"regarding class may be discussed with friends and colleagues outside of class.  Howe ver, "
"students may not discuss other students’ experiences, and must refrain from using any "
identifying information about their colleagues.  
Online Materials .  Students are expected to bec ome proficient at navigating Canvas .  Most 
assignments will be  upload ed by the student to Canvas unless otherwise noted. The course 
"syllabus, assignment description handouts, and any other supplementary info rmation can also be "
found on Canvas . 
Late Policy: Late assignments will lose a half letter grade off the total possibl e points for 
EVERY day that they are late.  Assignments more than two weeks late will not be accepted at 
"all.  In some cases, I am unwilling to accept late papers; this is generally for papers due near the "
end of the term so be sure to read the assignment descriptions carefully and ask questions if you 
are unsure. It is the student’s responsibility to stay on top of due dates. Students who wish to 
submit drafts of written work in advance of a due date should make arrangements with me at 
least ONE WEEK befor e the assignment is due. I strongly recommend keeping a calendar or 
planner for due dates.  
Academic Integrity .  Students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic 
integrity.  Cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated.  Students who are  caught breaking the 
student code of conduct will be reported to the Office of Student Affairs and receive a zero on 
"any relevant assignments.  Students who put full effort into mastering the course material, "
"integrating course objectives into their own pr ofessional and personal interests, developing "
"creative original work, and acknowledging sources should feel confident in their ability to "
achieve learning outcomes while maintaining high standards of integrity.  
http://www.pdx.edu/dos/psu -student -code -cond uct Support Services .  Students who would like assistance in approaching their written assignments 
"should visit the PSU Writing Center.  This is a free resource, though it does get busy towards the "
end of the quarter so it is important to make appointments  early.  Students may schedule regular 
appointments for assistance throughout the quarter.  http://www.writingcenter.pdx.edu/index.php    
"At the very least, I recommend that students consider having another person read their papers to "
"check for spelling and grammatical errors.  Everyone, even professional writers, should have an "
outside reader help him/her proofread his/her work.  
For additi onal support services and study skills assistance students may refer to the Skills 
"Enhancement and Tutoring Center (SETC), also a free resource for all PSU students.  "
http://www.pdx.edu/advising/academic -resources -and-services  
Students who need guidance on  proper formatting and style guides should refer to The OWL at 
Purdue. http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl .  Students who need assistance locating resources 
should consult the PSU Millar Library.  
"Title IX  of the Educational Act of 1972, which pertains to incidents of sex/gender "
"discrimination, sexual harassment and interpersonal violence:  "
"As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my "
"students and for the  campus as a whole. Please be aware that federal, state, and PSU policies "
"require faculty members to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or "
"other forms of prohibited discrimination. Similarly, PSU faculty are required to file a r eport if "

"participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, "
"useable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or cou rse design result in barriers "
"to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Disability  Resource Center (DRC) provides "
reasonable accommodations for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment.

Overview of Natural Science Inquiry  
 Natural Science Inquiry (NSI) is designed to engage you in scientific investigations of 
problems of the sort you might encounter as an attentive citizen.  The course uses no textbook 
and involves little formal lecture.  The learning you accomplish in this course will take place 
largely  through your own effort and the efforts of those with whom you work.   The use of 
"collaborative inquiry takes account of the fact that the modern sciences, as well as the "
"questions they address, require teamwork both within and between specific disciplines .  We "
wish to create a context within which this sort of teamwork is required to tackle the problems 
put before you.  
" As you will see right away, the schedule of events does not look like the listing of "
"lectures and textbook reading assignments that charac terize many science courses.  Instead, "
learning in Natural Science Inquiry is accomplished through inquiry -based projects on a variety 
of topics.  The successful completion of these projects requires  that you: (1) work 
"independently and collaboratively, (2 ) conduct literature reviews, (3) design experiments , (4) "
"use computers to analyze and interpret data, and (5) communicate science through writing and "
a poster.  
Student learning in this section of Natural Science Inquiry  
" As outlined above, this section o f Natural Science Inquiry (NSI) relies heavily on student -"
"directed projects and inquiry. This section of NSI is asynchronous online, which means that we "
"do not have set meeting times.  All the lectures, skills and course projects are online and can be "
acces sed at your convenience.  Throughout the term you are expected to work collaboratively 
"on a variety of connected projects that ultimately lead to the design, execution and "
communication of a natural science experiment .  The results of the final project will be 
communicated to the c lass and the instructor through a scientific poster .   
Course Goals  
Students will:  
• View science as a process for creating knowledge.  
• Be familiar with the basic characteristics of natural science research.  
• Distinguish science from pseudoscience.  
• Evaluate and critique knowledge claims.    
• Recognize and understand scientific  literature.  
"• Examine the role and influence of science in society, in culture and in policy -making.  "
• Use computers  and statistical software ( CRAN R) as a research tool.  
• Design and conduct a  natural science experiment .   
• Improve their ability to communicate scientific research through poster presentations . 
• Recognize the power and limits of science as a way of creating knowledge.

A video introduction to the course can be found in the course introduction section on Canvas .  
"This class is divided into multiple  learning units. Each l earning has a discussion, quiz and or a "
project associated with it. The due dates for each unit are listed  in the schedule and Canvas . 
This class is organized into groups that you will work with the entire term. Students in each 
grou p have been randomly assigned.  
Discussions:  Most learning units will have an online discussion activity associated with it. To get 
"full credit, students must participate in each discussion  for each learning uni t.  "
Quizzes  and exams : Course content and skills will be evaluated through quizzes and exams. The 
quizzes are always open and can be taken an unlimited  number of times . Quizzes are due 
before the corresponding midterm or final exam. Exams are open for 5 days  and can be taken 
"twice and must be complete by due dates l isted in Canvas . Exams cannot be taken late , no "
exceptions . 
Course Experiments : This course requires that your group design and conduct two scientific 
"experiment s. Surveys are not allowed.  For your safety, all experiments must be approved by "
the course instructor before data is collected.  Conducting experiments prior to approval will 
"result in a grade of zero for the associated project . In addition, a ll experiments  must include a "
video of each dependent sample being collected and measured . Experiments without a video 
or an incorrect video will receive a zero grade. There are several videos on Canvas that you 
may use as a model for your video.  
Groups: Groups for this class are rando mly assigned. You can meet your group members in the 
“Group Introductions” discussion. All assignments are conducted as a group. Quizzes and exams 
are individual.  
Peer Review:  The final course project will be evaluated  by other students during an online peer 
"review activity. The peer review is indiv idual , but you  may not participate in the peer  review "
activity until your  group has turned in a complete poster.   To be fair to all students in the 
"class, t he peer  review cannot be turn ed in late. Late peer reviews will receive a grade of zero.  "
Poster s: Posters describing your group’s  natural science experiment will be created by each 
"group using the template provided. Posters will be graded three  times: peer review, first draft "
and final draft.  
Data Collection Safety Guidelines : This class requires that you conduct simple experiments  in 
the field .   
• All experiments must be approved by the instructor before conducting the experiment.  
"• For your safety, it's strongly recommended that students travel to field locations during "
daylight and with another adult.   
"• For indoor lab work, have a responsible perso n within shouting distance in the event "
you need assistance.  
"• If you travel by car to a field site, the vehicle owner's personal auto insurance is the "
primary coverage in the event of an accident.   Students are expected to follow all 
applicable laws in the operation of their motor vehicle.

Course Requirements  
This capstone course is based on the expectations that individual students will share their own knowledge 
with each other to contribute to the class community and partnering community.   Under the service -
"learning philosophy, students will work individually, collaboratively as a team, and as an entire class "
community towards this mutually beneficial goal: to learn from doing work that is beneficial to the partner 
"community.   Mutual respect is expected to be given to classmates, to faculty, and to our partner s in the "
"community. Based on these components, there will be two categories of required assignments below:  "
 (NOTE:You  will find more detailed assignments/project descriptions in Canvas)  Individual Assignments   
"(a)  Canvas Discussions:  Initial reflection due by Wednesday  at latest, if assigned. Initial reflection "
entries should respond to the prompt in the Canvas Discussion tool. They are constructively aligned with 
the capstone spirit.   Each entry of Reflective writing should be about 150 -200 words in length and proof -
read (before being posted).   You are highly encouraged to demonstrate critical thinking processes and 
synthesis with other components (things you learned from the class and beyond).   *Combined grades of 
(a) & (b) will be given after each discussion week.  
"(b) Canvas Peer Feedback:  Peer feedback on the participation in Canvas must be submitted by Sunday , "
if assigned.   Read all of your classmates’ reflective writing entries and respond to at least two of them. 
"Posted discussion points should be thoughtful, proof -read (before being posted), respectful, and about "
50-100 words each in length.   The ideas shared in this way are vital contributions to the spirit of a 
classroom community and are tools to help each other learn. Please select the responses that haven’t  
received any comment first.  
(c) Canvas Reading Assignment Discussions : Your post on the assigned readings from our text due 
before midnight Sunday   Each  post should be about 150 -200 words in length and proof -read (before 
being posted).   You are highly encouraged to demonstrate critical thinking processes and synthesis with 
other components (things you learned from the class and beyond).   The reading assignment discussions 
"are open to everyone all through the class period, please read others' postings BEFORE you post "
"yours --unlike Canvas  Discussions (a) .  When adding a new post to the discussion, look to see if a thread "
"is already running for the same (or very similar) topic.   If so, reply to a post from your classmate; and if "
"not, please start a new thread. Every post should be original including your own reflections. Just like peer "
"feedback, all of your comments/posts are supportive and constructive following our class netiquette "
guideline we are practicing (Week One).  Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any further question 
at nariyo@pdx.edu .   
"(d) Individual Reflective Paper  due Sunday,  if assigned. Individual Reflective Writing entries should "
respond to assigned readings or other instructions (usually not from textbook readings above). All of the 
entries are constructively aligned with the capstone spirit. Writing entries should be: abo ut one page 
"(around 400 words), well -organized, and free of grammatical and spelling errors. Like other reflection "
"writing exercises, you are highly encouraged to demonstrate critical thinking processes and synthe sis "
with other components (things you learned from the class and beyond).   
"(e) Heritage Language Project  (2 pages - about 1,000 words).   This could be entirely reflections of your "
own heritage language(s) history including your brief interview of your family members.   OR you can 
select another person (with their permission) and write up the paper: an interview can be conducted 
"through email, online chats, phone or in person if the circumstance is allowed.   It can be an Indigenous or "
Immigrant heritage. Take a look at a separate instruction in Canvas.   
(f) Peer review of your team member’s Heritage language(s) project  (your total comments up to 200 
"words for each paper ).  Your comments will be constructive and supportive, including some questions "
that might help your team members to think further and encourage critical thinking processes.   This is part 
of group development activities.   
Team Assignments  
(a) Final Project Portfolio  
The final project portfolio includes (more detailed information in Canvas):  
• A list of potential & practical final project ideas  
• Project description  • Progress reports (1 & 2)  
• Project demonstration and feedback in class  
• Final product  
Small groups will be formed to research and prepare a final product which will be aimed at supporting the 
long-term language sustainability of our community partner.   The community partner will assist us in 
brainstorming a project idea and will provide feedback.   Each team will demonstrate the final projects (in 
"progress) in class, and everyone provided peer feedback in the process. It is required to use assigned "
"documents (Google Documents, others) if assigned for your collaborative development processes f or the "
prompt feedback and completion.  
"At the end of the term, each group will present our final products to our community partners.  "
(b)  Group Initiated Discussions

"1                Winter 2024 Syllabus  Capstone: Design & Edit for Organ Donation Outreach  UNST 421 ~ Section 514 ~ CRN 43671 Patrice Morris Ball, Instructor  Office hours by appointment ~ Patrice.Ball@pdx.edu The Capstone: Capstone courses are designed to build cooperative learning communities. A vital part of the capstone experience is working with a Community Partner (CP). Student teams will partner with a nonprofit agency CP (usually Donate Life Northwest or VisionGift) while learning about their mission to save/enhance lives through the promotion of organ, eye, and tissue donation. Students from a variety of majors and backgrounds work as a team, pooling resources, and collaborating with faculty and community leaders to understand and find solutions for issues that are important to them as literate and engaged citizens (http://capstone.unst.pdx.edu). Teams in this class will design/edit promotional documents (digital, video, electronic, or for print), while integrating knowledge, skills, and interests developed during their education, familiarity with today's popular culture, and the CP’s mission to increase registration of voluntary organ donors in the Pacific NW, and to honor individuals and their families who make the decision to donate.   The Four Goals of University Studies: https://www.pdx.edu/university-studies/program-learning-goals:  • Inquiry and Critical Thinking - Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula—problem posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners.  • Ethics, Agency, and Community - Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.  • Diversity, Equity and Social Justice - Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.  • Communication - Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways— writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.     Fully Online & [mostly] A-synchronous: In a traditional face-to-face class, you would be expected to attend every meeting. Because this course is fully online you are expected to be in Canvas regularly. Make it your practice to check it frequently, as important notices may be posted. It is your responsibility to fully engage in and contribute to your own learning experience. While this capstone course is largely a-synchronous, there will be two required team meetings (to be live, real-time, via zoom) planned to fit your schedule.  Time Commitment: Students in this 6-credit course should plan to spend 1-2 hours each evening (Monday-Thursday) on course readings, assignments, and discussion posts. Students will also be required to spend out-of-class time working on a final project.  UNST Policy: Due to the intensive nature of Capstones, students must receive permission from the course instructor prior to the first day of class if they are going to miss the first class session. For on-line Capstones, students must demonstrate active participation during the first week of the term. All Capstone courses factor in student attendance and participation into the final grade which is deeply impacted by missing the first week of the term. Policy regarding use of AI at PSU.  Attendance Required: Course attendance is required and is not awarded with additional points. Attendance is tracked by discussion participation. The overall experience for each member of our capstone class depends on interactions with fellow classmates because online classes work better and are more interesting and engaging when everyone is present and prepared to participate. You are required to make an initial post related to the prompt of the week by 11 pm every Tuesday, and a response to a classmate’s post by 11 pm on Thursday of the same week. It is expected that all participants will have read and considered assigned material prior to participating in online discussions to fully contribute and participate:       • Your original post serves as evidence that you have completed the reading. Bluffing will be called out.      • Be specific and add value to the discussion in your response (simply replying “yeah, I agree” adds no value to the discussion).       • Ask for clarification if you don’t understand a classmate’s post.      • Assume that everyone has good intentions and remember that assumptions can easily be cleared up through a private email.  Deductions: Points will be deducted for lack of attendance. Attendance absences and tardies (aka discussion participation) are tallied and posted in Canvas (Modules / Attendance). Your final grade will be reduced as a result of every late and/or missing post.   -2 points for Late Initial Post (posted after Tuesday 11pm but before Wednesday 11:00 pm); -3 points Absent or Late Response Post (entirely missing or posted after Thursday 11:00 pm);  -6 points when both your Initial & Response posts are missing or were made after Thursday 11:00 pm).  Extra Credit Discussion Posts: After the required two posts each week, additional comments of substance made by Thurs. 11:00pm will be awarded extra credit: one point each.  "
"2  Religious Accommodations Policy: Students requesting a religious accommodation should first make a reasonable effort to contact their instructors in an effort to agree upon a religious accommodation. If they are not able to agree, please contact the Office of the Dean of Student Life askdoslife@pdx.edu or (503) 725-4422 or visit SMSU 433.   Access and Inclusion for Students with Disabilities: PSU values diversity and inclusion. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) provides reasonable accommodations for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment. If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact the in SMSU 116, or https://www.pdx.edu/drc, or drc@pdx.edu or call (503) 725-4150. If you already have accommodations, please contact me (Patrice.Ball@pdx.edu) to make sure that I have received a faculty notification letter and to discuss your accommodations.   Email Policy: It is PSU policy that the University e-mail system be used for official communications to students. It is the responsibility of students to receive such emails (you can forward to a non-PSU email if you prefer) and respond to them as necessary.  Assignments: Written assignments are due every Wednesday by 11:00 pm in Canvas. Every document submission to the Canvas Assignment tool must include your name and the date, using basic (i.e. Times or Arial) black type. Points will be deducted from assignments for grammar and spelling errors, and for missing name / date at the top of the paper. Word count is only applicable where specifically mentioned. Please contact instructor if not clear. Weekly assignments submitted past the due date will have two points deducted for each day past the due date (<1 - 24 hours = 1 day). If a student anticipates missing course content or online activities, they should contact the instructor in advance by email: Patrice.Ball@pdx.edu Policy regarding use of AI at PSU.  By remaining in this course, you agree to the course conditions described above and the terms for grading as follows:  Grades: Grades in this course are not given by the instructor, they are earned by the students. Because this class is not graded on a curve, it is possible for every student to receive an “A” as their final grade. Note: a high grade is not possible if you miss assignments and discussions. Students will select their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice of final projects from the list provided. Instructor & community partners will attempt to assign students to their top choice if possible. Team assignments will be based on balance of project selections. Students will collaborate with team members throughout the term and deliver final team projects at the end of the term. Team members will evaluate one another on work effort and project participation for points for the final project, with input from the CP also considered.

Four or five projects are selected for team production each term, depending on student interest. Teams generally consist of 3-5 students. Despite the nature of the project, a mix of student skills and experiences is valued for every project. Everyone has something of value to contribute in the collaboration. See suggested roles and project structuring under “Modules” in Canvas WTR 2024.    Students will collaborate with their [final project] team members throughout the term, and deliver final team projects at the end of the term.

Class
Description
Thank
you
for
choosing
Refugee
and
Immigrant
Youth
in
Portland!
As
you
read
"this,"
over
110
million
people
around
the
world
can’t
go
home
safely.
This
is
the 
largest
number
of
forcibly
displaced
people
in
the
history
of
the
world.
Nearly
half
of
them
are 
children.
Many
of
these
people
have
found
new
homes
in
"Portland,"
whether
as
"refugees, "
"immigrants,"
"asylees,"
or
something
we
don’t
have
a
word
for.
In
this
class
we
will
study
the
global
phenomena
of
displacement
and
"migration,"
as
well
as
some
of
the
local
successes
and
challenges
newcomers
face
here
in
Portland.
All
of
us
who
"live,"
"work,"
and
study
here
are
stakeholders
in
this
important
conversation.
This
class
is
designed
to
better
equip
you
to
understand
first-hand
the
complexities
of
the
conversation
about
immigration
and
refugee
"resettlement,"
and
to
give
you
the
tools
and
understanding
to
make
"informed,"
responsible
choices
as
a
"student,"
"citizen,"
and
stakeholder .
We
will
study
current
and
historic
trends
in
immigration
and
refugee
resettlement
at
the
"global,"
"national,"
and
local
"level,"
with
an
emphasis
on
East
"Portland,"
including
successes
and
challenges
faced
by
immigrant
and
refugee
communities
and
the
institutions
that
serve
them.
As
a
Capstone
"course,"
field
work
plays
an
important
role
in
this
class.
We
will
partner
with
the
Immigrant
and
Refugee
Community
"Organization,"
a
Portland-based
non-profit
with
nearly
50
years
of
experience
serving
"refugees,"
immigrants
and
other
newcomers.University
Studies
Goals
The
University
Studies
Goals
are
an
integral
part
of
this
course
offering.
You
will
see
these
themes
show
up
in
our
classroom
activities
and
assignments
throughout
the
term.
I’ve
attached
specific
UNST
Goals
to
each
of
the
course
goals
listed
above
so
you
have
a
sense
for
how
they
relate
to
our
course
themes.

collaborate
effectively
with
others
in
group
"work,"
and
to
be
competent
in
appropriate
communication
technologies.
I

of
Human
Experience
-
Students
will
enhance
their
appreciation

of
differences
in
ethnic
and
cultural
"perspectives,"
"class,"
"race,"
"gender,"
sexual
"orientation,"
and
ability.
E

through
group
projects
and
collaboration
in

Course
Design
This
course
may
feel
different
than
other
courses
you
have
taken
in
the
past.
Each
of
you
brings
particular
expertise
from
your
majors
and
life
experiences
to
this
"course,"
and
your
presence
and
participation
in
class
"matter,"
so
please
attend.
You
will
be
asked
to
contribute
this
expertise
to
our
class
"activities,"
assignments
and
to
your
final
group
project.For
both
in-person
and
on-line
"activities,"
your
participation
is
critical
to
a
successful
learning
experience
in
this
course.
In
the
capstone
"setting,"
"students,"
"instructors,"
and
community
partners
are
viewed
as
co-teachers
and
co-learners.
We
will
work
together
to
achieve
goals
that
both
benefit
your
educational
experience
and
meet
a
real
need
in
the
community .
If
you
have
any
questions
or
"concerns,"
or
are
facing
any
difficulties
or
barriers
to
your
full
experience
of
this
"class,"
please
let
me
know
immediately .
I
am
here
to
help
you
get
the
most
from
this
class.
I
am
always
happy
to
schedule
time
to
talk
on
the
"phone,"
Zoom
or
in-person.
Expectations
1.
Class
participation
is
divided
roughly
into
4
parts:
in-person
"class,"
online
"activities,"
field-based
experiential
learning
through
"volunteering,"
and
individual
learning.
We
meet
in
person
on
Tuesdays.
Online
participation
mostly
consists
of
Canvas
online
discussion
posts
due
on
Thursdays.
Volunteering
will
vary
from
individual
to
individual
and
position
to
position.
Individual
learning
(reading
"assignments,"
some
homework)
happens
on
your
"schedule,"
but
generally
must
be
completed
by
Tuesday’s
in-person
sessions.
Please
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
barriers
to
accessing
Canvas
or
any
other
online
learning.
2.
Participation.
You
will
co-teach
much
of
this
class.
Through
small
group
"assignments,"
online
discussion
"posts,"
in-class
"presentations,"
and
classroom
"conversations,"
your
participation
is
critical
not
only
for
you
but
for
your
classmates.
Please
attend
at
least
9
of
10
of
our
in-person
classes
and
complete
on-line
discussion
posts
and
responses
on
time.
3.
You
are
expected
to
engage
in
a
meaningful
volunteer
activity
to
do
field
based
learning
in
support
of
refugee
and
immigrant
youth
and
families.
Our
field-based
experiential
learning
will
be
done
in
partnership
with
the
Immigrant
and
Refugee
Community
"Organization,"
a
community
based
organization
with
nearly
50
years
of
service
in
Oregon.
Please
visit
and
select
a
volunteer
position
that
interests
you
at
https://irco.org/volunteer-for-irco/
.
Once
you
have
selected
a
"position,"
apply
through
the
hyperlinks
attached
to
each
volunteer
position.
If
you
have
an
existing
relationship
with
a
similar
organization
doing
like
"work,"
please
talk
to
me
about
the
possibility
of
volunteering
with
an
organization
other
than
IRCO.
4.
My
role
will
be
carried
out
as
a
facilitator
and
instructor.
As
the
facilitator/instructor
it
will
be
my
job
to
"organize,"
provide
"structure,"
and
facilitate
the
class.
I
will
be
flexible
so
that
when
you
have
comments
or
"concerns,"
they
can
be
addressed
without
hesitation.
5.
If
you
have
questions
or
concerns
please
email
me
at
the
email
listed
above.
If
there
is
an
urgent
"need,"
please
text
or
call
me
at
the
number
above.
I
prefer
"email,"
but
call
or
text
if
it
is
urgent.
I
will
try
to
reply
to
emails
within
48
hours
and
to
texts
or
calls
within
24
hours.Mandatory

"personal awareness of how to be effective in the world :  Inquiry, Critical Thinking, "
"Communications, Quantitative Literacy, Effective Writing, Diversity, Equity, Social Justice, Ethics, "
"Agency, Community, and Trauma Informed Approaches to interactions with ot hers.  These "
topics represent University Studies goals - we will be integrating them throughout the term and 
"working with application of definitions of these terms, provided to you in the Getting started "
Documents - Goal Terms & Definitions : Foundational Strategies for the Course & Beyond.  
STUDENT LED LEARNING (Instructor Guidance as needed)  
"You will not be told specifically what to do, only generally what needs to be done.  Stronger learning "
happens when students learn to trust their own voice and solut ions. You will be shown all the 
"necessary basics but each and every major decision along the way will be made by you individually, "
within your Functional Task Areas and by the class as a whole. This is a group -dynamic experience where 
"you will learn more a bout yourself and others and some external community . In this capstone, you'll "
also know at the end how to make interactive online media with an integrated marketing strategy. More 
"importantly, you'll be able to recognize more readily the subtle shift in d irection as a project moves "
closer to success or closer to problems and be able to apply this knowledge at an earlier point in the 
"future on your own. This class is about empowering the learning, leadership and creative and result -"
"driven building capacitie s of each and every student. I seek to increase your critical thinking skills, your "
leadership and team skills and your ability to create something that has actual measurable influence in 
"the world, in this case, the readership we can track, in the communi ty of our global readership on "
specific topics.  
Multimedia Capstone Synopsis & Definition of Multimedia  
"What Is Multimedia? Multimedia is the use of a computer to present and combine text, graphics, audio, "
"and video with links and tools that let the user navigate, interact, and communicate.  "
You combine all your learning to date in a class where you learn more by creating a useful product or 
"service for a community based interest. You will practice 'Community -based Learning,' and you will work "
with people unlike yourself; both within and outside the class. You will learn by discussions and 
"negotiations with Functional Task Area members  and class members, through producing a product for "
"the community use,  and through written reflection.  "
"We make interactive media using existing software, English, visual imagery, and tools to make digital "
content.  You'll learn an overview of all team components necessary to build a project from conception 
"to completion, and have a focused understanding of at least  one particular Functional Task Area. The "
"areas of major emphasis are: Client Liaison/Research (Cl/R), Content Development (CD), User "
"eXperience/User Interface(UX/I), Technical (T) and Marketing (M). You will self divide into these "
Functional Task Areas. A rea leads will share information between the different Functional Task Areas.  
FUNCTIONAL TASK AREAS  
"CL/R - Client Liaison/Research - Responsible for gathering accurate data, from client or through "
community research.. CL is the eyes and ears of the class . CL responds to requests from the class for 
"more information, subject material, and content. CL may conduct interviews and be the primary contact "
"with the community contacts. CL Is the primary conduit between community  groups & contacts, "
"exchanging cours e project information in, and outside the class.  "
CD Content Development  – CD works in conjunction with CR and CL/R to take facts and information 
"gathered and tailor it for use. This involves formatting and writing text, creating credits and reference "
"pages, tracking references with CL, and performing multiple grammar and spelling checks using a three "
"step process (word -by-word, paragraph & page, and backwards) creating graphics, formatting photos "
"and/or video and/or audio, as determined by the class. VIDEO - anyone interested in video development "
"and editing, self identifies, and works to specifically develop video content.  "
"UXI - User Experience/User Interface   First, responsible for deciding how best to present information "
"using colors, texture, graph ics, illustrations, photos, videos, sound animation and interactivity. How best "
"to convey ideas from one mind to another given limitations in the digital world. Second, take these "
"decisions and create an overall flow chart (site map) and draw out how pages  link. Third, detail out the "
"major sections in terms of storyboard, mood, tone, and interactivity; and document the page name and "
the page links. Work closely with the CD and T functional areas.  
"T - Technical  - INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE -First, responsible for assessing technical capabilities of the "
"class, and the lab assets as they are configured for your particular term. Practice developing complete "
"pathways from start to end before committing to that path wit h major classwork. In other words, before "
"agreeing to include embedded video, practice digitizing video and placing small sections into a test "
"interactive structure. There are four areas of distinct responsibility in Technical; Developing, importing "
"and as sembling, converting acquired data to digital form and appropriately formatting.  "
"M – Marketing – Develops Marketing Strategy working with Cl/R, CD and UXI. Helps maintain ‘branding’ "
aspects throughout the term. Helps keep groups on main mission and on tar get with stated goals. Tracks 
"blog analytic results, and applies lessons learned through web analytics. Uses, maintains, and further "
grows the link of marketing and social media tools used to promote the blog.  
About Functional Task Area LEADS -  Each FTA  selects  a lead.  Leads communicate and coordinate 
"vertically, with people in that FTA , and horizontally, with other FTA leads. They will mark the QR sheet  - "
"a tool given in week 1 - area with asterisks by their X, like this *X*  FTA leads must be in pl ace by week 2. "
The same person can do it all term or it can rotate among FTA members. If  Leads are not self selected 
"by week 2, the instructor will apply the lead status to someone in each FTA.   "
8 Milestones - Understand the relationship between milestone s and dates. Milestones roughly align 
"with the weeks of the term, but they don’t have to exactly. Milestones are used instead of dates because "
what is important is completing the sequence properly before moving to the next one. It does not matter 
"if Milest one 1 takes a little longer, or Milestone 2 is completed more quickly. These are decisions made "
inside the class and tracked on a Gannt chart.  
Hard deadlines -  
1. Midterm -  a set deadline in Week 5.  
2. Final - a set deadline in Week 10.   
3. Responsibility Shee t entry  - each Friday  starting Week 2  
4. Blog post 1 - published & approved by first day of week 6  
5. Blog Post 2  - published & approved by first day of week 10  
MILESTONES (applied to the Main project)  
Milestone 1 (Analysis)  
Develop email groups and introduce the blog. Select Functional Task Areas. Everyone has email for 
"everyone else plus those in their own FTA. Everyone is familiar with the free online tools, and is able to "
communicate effectively with each other and the ins tructor through the Canvas class site or using PSU 
"regular email, or PSU Google chat and Meet, or Zoom, or text.  Legacy elements from previous classes "
and the instructor may be examined and discussed. Study the topic for the term..  Everyone is up and 
running on the Quick Reference Sheet (QR) introduced week 1).  
Milestone 2  (Analysis & Conceptualization)  
Brainstorm ideas. Begin drawing and discussing ideas. Begin experimenting with hardware/software and 
"capture equipment. Begin listing project elements. Attempt to prioritize, count and sequence elements "
of the project. Continue gathering and begin filtering raw data. Content Development prototypes some 
file modules which may be used later.  
Milestone 3 (Conceptualization & Solution Design)  
Mission statem ent exists and is in use. End user is defined as a demographic and we know how we want 
to alter their thoughts and/or behaviors. Everyone has a sense of how they plan to contribute to the 
project. The official external Blog has its first entries for the ne w term.  
Milestone 4 (Solution Design)  
"Development modules, composed of elements which support specific points we wish to make, are "
"defined, and beginning to appear in the Blog and on the site. Camera crews (if used) begin practicing; "
"subdividing into cap turing on tape and editing to digital files, same with audio, if used. Other sub areas "
"may form; animation, etc.  "
UXi transfers designs to Technical and assists in development. Files are assembled in central locations 
"(with back -ups please!)  The blog is u nderway, analytics are being used in the blog tool, and marketing is busy generating buzz and creating traffic. The website or other final product  is under development.  "
Milestone 5 (Solution Design)  
"All FTAs  are communicating well with each other, each group and each individual has a solid role.  "
Milestone 6  (Solution Development)  
"No new ideas are introduced unless absolutely essential. Everyone is double -checking the work; edits, "
"quality control. Content Development is creating file work, formatting o ther files, digitizing text, and "
working with CR to finalize Layout and Global Navigation schema. Content Development is primarily 
concerned with how class ideas are expressed in text (some imagery) UXi group is more focused on 
"imagery, layout and the coll ective visual impact of all elements, and how they are experienced by the "
user. A simple way to understand UXi is this - make the text and graphics clean and the interactions 
intuitive.  
Milestone 7  (Solution Application)  
Credits are developed and include information on the class and our sources. References are 
documented and presented on the official Blog and/or website. Marketing is preparing a final analysis 
"and recommendation. The big project; website/video, is reviewed while there is still time to make  any "
final adjustments.  
Milestone 8 (Evaluation - of work performed and success of content developed)  
"The class makes final tweaks and adjustments to the project work, the course website built and the blog. "
The blog has a functional link featured near the top leading to the class website for the term. The class 
"website has a featured link going to the blog. The blog and website are functioning.  All necessary data, "
"passwords, usernames and URLs are documented on one word document and put in the group si te AND "
given to the instructor by placing them inside the google docs aligned with that term's project.   A final 
"quality control check - are the styles consistent? Is the brand of the blog represented well with image, "
title and layout? Does the site look and feel professional and high quality?  
"There is an informal presentation made by the class, online, discussing and presenting group work "
accomplished during the term.  
About the Midterm and Final  
"These papers are to be thoughtful introspective and analyti cal essays, and will be submitted in Canvas "
"and also emailed to bremmer@pdx.edu   You will receive your paper graded, with comments on the "
midterm to help for the final.  
Course Grading Criteria:  
1 - Midterm =              Possible 200 points  
2 - Final  =                     Possible 300 points  
3 - Blog Post #1  =                       100 points if complete (all or none)  4 - Blog Post #1  =                       100 points if complete (all or none)  
5 - Final Project presented = 200 points  
"Blog entries : A typical entry on the class -maintained blog will be relevant to the mission of the term, "
unique from other entries already posted.  A successful post has -  
- Relevant Title  
- Supporting photo or graphic  
- Compelling & persuasive writing  
"- A link to further steps, resources or to learn more  "
-  URL from the official class blog proving it is published  
You send me the published URL in Canvas and by email to bremmer@pdx.edu . I comment with guidance 
to make it approvable or I approve it on the spot. if it has the five listed components here.  
Blog Post #1 approved by the start of Week 6 and Blog post #2 approved by the start of week 10.  
"Midterm. The midterm will be posted the m iddle week of the term, (week 5 in Fall, Winter, and Spring "
AND Week 4 in Summer) It consists of essay type questions about the book Changing Minds and about 
the class and examining your results and experiences in the class. You will have at least 4 days t o get the 
midterm to me. Please email it to me in the body of an email at bremmer@pdx.edu   and also put it in 
Canvas.  
Final.  The final will be posted last week of the term and will consist of essay type questions about the 
"book Changing Minds and about the class and how your results and experiences in the class, and will "
also ask you to compare and contrast against your mid -term goals. You will also be asked to reflect upon 
"community and community based learning as it is applied in this class, and respond to questions "
"involving social justice, diversity and equity issues, which are a major part of the class and a key driver "
"for what we do. Like the midterm, you will have at least 4 days to complete the final, which will come "
"out during the last week of the term, usually towards the end of the week. Please email it to me in the "
body of an email at bremmer@pdx.edu  and also in Canvas.  
Responsibility sheet. Each individual will be responsible for completing their goal for that week on the 
responsibility sheet. This is a tab that will appear WEEK 1 on the QR sheet.  
The Responsibility Sheet is about what the individuals in each group say they will do. It’s about integrity. 
"state your goal and try to make it - if you don’t, reframe it the next week and move on. Points are for "
"engaging, not for being perfect. The other main use of the sheet is to read what others say. Look for "
"patterns. Look for others who are interested in the same things you are, or who you might want to reach "
out to.  
Reflective Response paragraph. Each class member will provide a paragraph per week supporting the 
"UNST goal a nd critical thinking,, starting in week 2. They will also find a paragraph written by another "
student and respond to that paragraph.  This is a good way to get to know each other and how those 
"who will be helping you on the project, think.   "
Your share of work on the final project. The final project is a shared group project. Everyone has an 
opportunity to participate in the final project. I encourage people to share components whenever 
possible.  There will be a question on the final paper asking what comp onents you were responsible for 
"researching, or creating, or implementing, or aiding others on a shared component. You must document "
"in the final essay response when asked, what you did, and how it impacted the project. You must also "
name another member in  the class who is aware of the work you did and could verify if asked that you 
did that work.  
Grades are calculated after the final at the end of the term. If you want to know your standing in the 
"class, or you have specific concerns about your grade in the class, contact me at any time or look in "
Canvas at what is collected up to that point in time.  
Course Integration with University Studies Goals  
"INQUIRY & CRITICAL THINKING - In our course, we achieve this goal by addressing real -world "
sustainability  and environmental economic problems affecting actual populations. We apply methods 
"from psychology, writing, graphic design, marketing, internet technology, and political policy in a team "
"setting, emphasizing the importance of inquiry, critical thinking, and collaboration for success.  "
"COMMUNICATION - In our class, we employ various communication tools like writing, online messages, "
"phone, video, chat, instant messaging, graphic design, photography, and internet skills. Our focus - "
"creating new digital con tent from scratch, supporting specific causes. Also, we actively contribute to an "
"ongoing blog, expanding a body of content for a growing global readership. This happens individually "
"and in small student collaborations, all while applying project managemen t and marketing "
communication skills.  
"DIVERSITY, EQUITY, & SOCIAL JUSTICE - In our course we address issues crossing all possible "
"demographics. Knowing this, we use techniques developed by people such as Howard Gardner in order "
to create inclusive content  approachable by all groups. Through online marketing and strategy we can 
create methods where remote viewers can share  information we create with others who do not have 
internet access.   
"ETHICS, AGENCY & COMMUNITY - In this class we apply ethical decis ion making to our agency - how we "
freely choose to act and implement within a community - to make change.

 Community Event Planning 
 UNST 421-528  Winter 2024  Hybrid Course [Canvas] 
 Instructor: Glorie Gary 
 Email:  totteng@pdx.edu 
 Call or T ext: 503-969-0301 
 This Capstone’ s partner is the Portland Parks & Recreation’ s  Adaptive and Inclusive 
 Recreation Program  (PPRAIR). 
 This class is designed to facilitate a community event. 
 The primary module and structure for this class is fully online and all materials are 
 coordinated through PSU’ s Canvas system module for this course. W e will have 
 multiple interactions throughout the term via technology (Zoom) to “meet” face to face 
" and interact, as well as some required and voluntary in person meetings. There is a "
" REQUIRED out of class requirement towards the end of the term, as you are required to "
 attend our event in the community to pass this course. If you do not attend the event at 
" the end of the term, it will be dif ficult for you to pass this class (unless another option "
 has been previously arranged). 
" Event Date: one 6 hour period during the week of March 1 1, 2024. T imes will vary , and "
 days will vary . We will have specific days and times (along with a general theme) by the 
" end of the 2nd week of class. Y ou will be paired with 3 other students, and each group "
 of 4 will have their own event (you will not be required to participate in all 4 events - 
 ONLY your own group’ s event). 
" For a description of UNST Capstone goals and links to the handbooks for Students, "
" Faculty and Community Partners’ roles and responsibilities, please refer to  this site  . You "
 are responsible for reading and understanding the roles and responsibilities as a 
 student in this course. 
" “Learning is the only thing the mind never exhausts, never fears, and never regrets.” "
 - Leonardo Da V inci  Be proactive with your own experience in this class. It matters. 
 This Capstone is designed to engage in our community through meaningful action. W e 
 will develop a mutually beneficial “final product” of collaborative design by working 
 together to create and complete a service learning opportunity . The objectives of this 
 Capstone also address both course content and the University Studies goals of: 
" ●  Communication: enhance your capacity to communicate in various ways, "
" collaborate ef fectively with others, and be competent in appropriate "
 communication technologies. 
" ●  Inquiry and critical thinking: problem solving, conceptualizing, and being active, "
" self motivated, empowered learners. "
" ●  Diversity , Equity & Social Justice: explore and analyze identity , power "
" relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings "
 from multiple perspectives. 
" ●  Ethics, Agency & Community: examine values, theories and practices that inform "
" your actions, reflect on your personal choices, and how your actions impact local "
 and global communities. 
" By the end of the course through daily and weekly assignments, you will have "
 completed the following objectives: 
" ●  Discuss and apply event planning skills/methodology to our event(s), and gain "
 understanding how event planning skills might be adapted to other situations. 
 ●  Develop an understanding and appreciation of the needs and challenges that 
" individuals from varied backgrounds and experiences face, and how that "
 understanding might apply to event planning. 
 ●  Examine a variety of issues that arise in event planning such as contingency 
" planning, audience assessment and event design, and implement strategies for "
 addressing issues. 
 ●  Practice viewing social equity from multiple perspectives and construct 
 independent meaning and interpretations - we will question and critique 
 “tradition” in the things we do. 
 ●  Facilitate healthy and functional perceptions around both dif ferences and 
 similarities experienced within our own classroom community and with those 
 participating in our event. 
 ●  Increase your ability to apply concepts to practical action. 
 ●  Reflect on your personal ef ficacy to make a dif ference in the lives of others in 
" your local community , and on your role and responsibility in participating with "
 others towards a public purpose or common good.  ●  Reflect on how your own perspective has changed or developed in relationship to 
 the community issues addressed as a result of this Capstone experience. 
" ●  Deepen your ongoing identification with, and participation in, a shared "
 community . 
 “A successful assignment will have a piece of yourself in it …. 
" Your true thoughts and experiences integrated into the material you provide, "
 and that you leave something and make sure you take something away .” 
 - Previous Capstone Student 
" Due to the nature of this class, some aspects  will  be  ambiguous at first, but will get "
 more specific as the term goes on. My job is to give you the tools to succeed. Y our job is 
" to apply yourself to our course objectives, and complete assignments and "
 responsibilities as necessary for this course. Much of what we do will be flexible and 
 adapt based on the ever changing needs of our project (and our community partner). 
 Our week-to-week schedule will change slightly or drastically as required by our needs 
 to complete our project. 
 I expect the following of everyone in this class: 
" ●  To participate in our class community , to be visible, and to empower each other "
 through example and intention. 
 ●  To pay attention to meaning created in our “classroom” and community setting. 
" ●  To be open to outcome, rather than attached to process. "
 ●  To practice being ourselves. 
 ●  To make learning fun and engaging. 
 These ideas are adapted from Angeles Arrien’s book “The Four-Fold Way” which supports an individual’s 
" quest for wisdom, creative expression, health and ability to adapt to change. "
" This class relies on collaborative teamwork as a means for learning, and represents a "
 learning community in which each person plays a significant role in the total group’ s 
" intellectual growth and performance. In order for everyone to achieve this, students "
 must work together to maintain positive interactions and show tolerance and interest in 
" each other ’s progress. Therefore, it is important that we create a safe and comfortable "
 learning environment and celebrate each other ’s diversity and diverse backgrounds. W e 
" will take the time to recognize each other ’s experiences, learning styles and strengths, "
 and listen with respect. 
 A key aspect of this course comes through each of us bringing our learning and 
 experience from our individual lives to the classroom setting so that we might all expand  our understanding of the issues we face in our communities and the threads that 
" connect us to them.  The diversity each of you brings  to this experience is a resource, "
" strength, and benefit  . Our intent in activities and  assignments in this class will be "
 respectful of this diversity . 
" Your thoughts, experiences and feedback is encouraged, appreciated, and valued. "
" Since we don’t “see” each other physically in a classroom setting week to week, you are "
 “invisible” unless you participate online in the functions set up in our online classroom 
" setting. Please keep that in mind. In an online class, you are essentially “absent” when "
 you are not participating and interacting. 
 Our class is structured within a weekly format. Due dates are posted with each 
" individual assignment. Assignments may be completed early , as long as they are within "
 two weeks of the due date. Please refrain from completing the assignment sooner than 
 that unless otherwise noted for that assignment (or previous arrangement made with 
 me). 
 An important note about communication: since there are multiple forms of potential 
" communication possible,  our main form of communication  in the class will be via "
 “Announcements” (on the Canvas course page) and utilizing the PSU email system 
 (NOT the Canvas email module)  . If you want me to use  a different email than your 
" pdx.edu email, please let me know . I will be happy to use other email addresses for "
 communication. I will always use an “Announcement” on our Canvas page for anything 
" you need to know . Conversely , if you need something announced to the entire class "
" related to our course, email me the request and I will add it as an Announcement. "
 Also: did you see my cell number at the top of this syllabus? Please use it. T ext if you 
 don’t want to call. Call if you have a quick question that you need answered before 
 moving to the next step in an assignment or to make a decision. Y ou are not interrupting 
" me, and if I can’t take a call (or out of cell range), it will go to voicemail and I will get "
 back to you. I would SO MUCH rather you call or text me to get information you need to 
" move you forward in your learning or decision making process, than having you “pause” "
" while you wait for an answer from me. Email is great - you can do that, too. But for "
 something you need right away - call or text. Please. 
" There is no formal text for this course, but you will be required to access written "
 materials and online information over the course of the term. Most materials are free  access. There may be a time or two where you might need to pay for something (a 
" movie rental, for example). "
 We will respect and welcome in our classroom (and community event) individuals of all 
" backgrounds, identities, and abilities. "
" If you need any physical or other accommodation to succeed in this class, please "
 contact me and/or contact the  Disability Services  Office  [435 Smith Center] at (503) 
" 725-4150. I am happy to assist you in any way I can, and promise to maintain the "
 confidentiality of these discussions. 
" If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities dif ficult, "
" please let me or Seanna Kerrigan (  kerrigs@pdx.edu  ,  Capstone Director , UNST). W e will "
 do our very best to help you succeed in this course. 
 You will be surprised at how many dif ferent resources PSU has to of fer students. There 
" are weekly food boxes, a clothes closet, counseling, tutoring, religious services, sports "
" events, a game room, bowling, an Outdoor Program -- just to name a few . Do you need "
 a resource or assistance? I am very happy to point you in the right direction and do my 
 very best to help you succeed. Please just let me know . Don’t be shy - you are 
" important, your education is important, and to get a good education you also need to "
 have your needs met in other areas of life. Y ou matter . Speak up for yourself. 
" As an Adjunct Instructor , students frequently come to me for assistance in matters that "
 are not related to the course material. Please be aware that PSU’ s policies require 
" instructors to report any instance of sexual harassment, sexual and relationship "
" violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination to University Of ficials, who keep "
 the information private. If you would rather share information about these experiences 
 with a PSU staf f member who does not have these reporting responsibilities and can 
" keep the information confidential, please contact one of the following campus "
 resources.

 PSU Sexual Misconduct Response website  gives you comprehensive 
 information about how to support and/or report an incident. Y ou may also 
 report sexual and relationship violence to law enforcement on campus

 report  with Campus Public Safety Of fice  or a  Bias Incident report  with the

 that are made through these two avenues. These reports help PSU 
 understand what students and employees are experiencing on and around 
 campus and provide support where needed. 
 “Grades do not measure intelligence. I don’t care about your grade. I care more about 
 the integrity by which you come to the end of the term than I do a grade.” 
" - Your Instructor , Glorie Gary "
 What grade do you want? My final grading process may be a bit ambiguous to students 
 who are used to a “standard” way of measuring “success” in the classroom setting. 
" Based on my own experiences and teaching philosophy , those traditional ways of "
 measuring “success” do not work for this course and you should expect to feel a bit 
 uncomfortable with the process. Y ou will go through a self grading process at the end of 
" the term as part of your Capstone Reflection process. In this course, you should “claim "
" and count” every aspect of your experience - your thinking, your feeling, your doing, and "
 your reflecting on that doing - and to grade yourself for your ef forts and the results of 
 those ef forts. 
" Since this process is a bit scary and ambiguous to most students, and since it is "
" necessary to assign a final grade to students after completing the course, a reminder to "
" students that “A” actually does mean “Above Expectations” and, therefore, would mean "
 that you went  above and beyond the basic requirements  of the class in every 
" assignment and expectation  .  If you are unsure at any time during the course of your potential final grade for the class, "
" you should contact me, and we will discuss it together . Of course, I have set numerical "
" value on the assignments throughout the course - and in that manner , you can get an "
 idea of where you might “fit” into a standard grade at any time by looking at the 
 “Grades” section of this course. Y ou are in charge of your grade in this course. 
 Final Grades will be posted to the Student Information System prior to the PSU Grades 
 deadline. A grade of “Incomplete” is not possible in this class. 
" By remaining in this class, you agree to the conditions set forth here, including the "
 course requirements and the terms outlined in this syllabus.

"means o f immersion. However, there i s a growing disparity i n the s chool s ystems t hat  allow o nly the "
privileged s tudents
 to participate i n  meaningful and engaging cultural learning by traveling abroad. 
Schools that receive funding and support are a ble to facilitate cultural exchanges i n  person f or 
"students a nd faculty , while the m ajority o f students  in the public s ystem r eceive l ittle ﬁ nancial s upport "
and
 are left without a ny type o f cultural exchange o r enrichment program. T his capstone w ill provide 
this needed and valuable cultural exchange completely online. 
"This course focus is to create andparticipate ina vibrant online cultural exchange platform, in English, "
with primary andsecondary students in  rural Spain. Our community partner is: 
●The Colegio Rural Agrupado (CRA) de Tábara is a school that is formed by grouping together
school children from several small towns in the municipal region of Tábara which is located in
the province of Zamora.
The students range in ages from 3-13 years of age and are learning English. Students are at a 
beginner level (low-intermediate). It is not necessary that the PSU student speak S panish. 
"For capstone students, this course will include an introduction to online tools and platforms, material "
related to pedagogy and global competence and most importantly cultural information about Spain 
"and Tabara (Spain). Each term, Capstone students create English learning and cultural activities "
requested by our community partners. 
Additionally capstone students will also engage in cultural and pedagogical discussion forums with 
teachers in Zamora. These discussion forums will take place on Canvas . The objective of these 
discussion forum s is to increase c ultural awareness  and promote robust conversations about each 
other's respective culture and cultural knowledge. 
In order to participate in this dynamic online project students will need to have reliable internet access. 
"There are no synchronous discussions or meetings in this course. A computer , tablet or phone will be "
"needed with a camera, microphone, and speakers. The course will use a variety of free applications and "
"platforms; some examples are Zoom, YouT ube, Vimeo, Adobe Creative Cloud Express and/or other "
similar products. All instruction will be provided for any online tools utilized in this capstone. 
This capstone is perfect for students that have an interest in learning about Spain and for those 
"studying or interested in the following: primary , secondary and higher education, any work related to "
"children, ESL/ TEFL/TESOL, social work, international af fairs, community development, anthropology, sociology, Spanish, Hispanic studies and much more. This Capstone is relevant to the "
"following  studies (minor, major, certiﬁcate, masters): Applied Linguistics, TESOL certiﬁcate, MA "
"TESOL, Education, International Studies, European Studies, Global Studies, English and Spanish.  "

"topics or discussions: regional current events or issues, cultural traditions and current global issues. "
The goal is  to promote and encourage conversations about cultural awareness and global 
competence in the classroom and to reinforce English language learning. By learning about different 
cultures and societal norms all participants will build their own awareness of the role of beliefs and 
values in their lives and in the lives of others. This purpose of this program is to expose and educate 
all students (Capstone and Tábara) and teachers about their  own culture and Spanish culture. Today 
"societies are becoming multicultural, and the world cultures are increasingly becoming more "
"connected through technology and mobility, therefore, educating students about the differing "
"cultures, concerns a nd beliefs will prepare them for daily interaction in their community and outside "
it. They will develop a deeper understanding of themselves as both citizens of their nation and global 
citizens. Direct interaction with people from different countries will reinforce the civic values learned 
"in the classroom and bring them to life. Moreover, learning about culture and beliefs promotes cross- "
cultural understanding that is essential to empathy and world peace. This program gives students the foundations for a civic dialogue with those outside their 
community and helps to equip t hem to live ina world of diverse cultures and beliefs. 
The following are objectives of this program for primary  and secondary students: 
"●To provide opportunities for students, teachers and parents from different countries"
"to engage directly in dialogue on culture, traditions, beliefs, concerns and global"
issues.
●To foster respect and understanding among students of diverse cultural groups
"with differing beliefs, traditions and views."
"●To increase  student, teacher  and parent  literacy  about  cultures, concerns and beliefs"
through dialogue and collaborative learning.
There are a variety of cultural assignments and projects. These projects consist in students 
"contributing individually, smaller cultural projects that will form part of a class project. Students will "
"participate actively in discussion forums (interdisciplinary students-instructors) that require timely responses in order to have an active conversation. Completing tasks on time and participating actively, students will be contributing to the collective group work. Our group consists of PSU "
"students, K-12 Spanish students  and Spanish teachers from Tábara, Zamora. The handbook from "
University Studies for Capstone students states the following regarding working in groups:“Capstones require that students work in interdisciplinary teams to address a critical need in the 
community. This experience offers several opportunities for personal and professional growth.” 
"For more information, read pages 11-13 from the Student Handbook ( https://capstone.unst.pdx.edu/ "

Instructor role: 
"As your capstone instructor , I will serve as a facilitator and advisor for your experience. Our work in the "
classroom should build a context for thinking more deeply as you provide service to our  community 
partner . This is a community-based class not only in your service work but also in the classroom. The 
"classroom community is built by all of us in an open, honest and critical space. "
Student role: 
You are part of a community and thus need to be a socially responsible member and learner . Your 
"professional, meaningful and respectful interactions with one another and our community partner are "
"vital to this capstone. Your grade will be based on your writings, discussions, curriculum development "
"and project participation. As a reminder this is a 6 credit, 400 level course and will require the "
"anticipated workload. Most importantly , an online course requires organization, dedication and can be "
"demanding and cumulative in nature, since a considerable amount of material is covered in a "
relatively short period of time.Y ou are strongly encouraged to seek help from your instructor  at the ﬁrst 
"sign of difﬁculty, and to keep up with the work on a daily basis. "

Course description : 
COURSE OBJECTIVES  
"• Develop and practice critical thinking skills together through research, "
"investigation, close readings, critical analysis, and discussion.  "
• Explore ethical issues and soci al responsibility through engagement with 
"community and social justice issues,  "
"• Learn visual and oral communication skills through writing, collaborative "
"group work, discussion, and presentations.  "
• Learn the importance and strength of diversity through engagement with 
"community, classmates, and class materials. Class will consistently engage "
an intersectional analysis of identity and power.   
University Studies Learning Goals:  
• Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in 
"various ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral "
"means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be "
competent in appropriate communication technologies.  
• Inquiry and Criti cal Thinking : Students will learn various modes of inquiry 
"through interdisciplinary curricula —problem-posing, investigating, "
"conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, and empowered "
"learners. • Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice : Students will explore and analyze "
"identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and "
contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.  
"• Ethnicity, Agency, and Community:  Students will examine values, theories, "
and practices that inform their actions and reflect on how personal choices 
and group decisions impact local and global communities.

Portland State University Policies and Resources  
Academic Integrity:  
I am not here to police you. Out of respect for our time together and this 
learning opportunity please practice academic integrity. Below is Portland State 
University’s definition of academic integrity take from ( https://www.pdx.edu/dean -
student-life/academic -misconduct): 
"Academic integrity is critical to maintaining fair , knowledge -based learning at "
Portland State University. Academic misconduct in any form is a serious violation: 
it undermines the bonds of trust and honesty between members of our academic 
"community, degrades the value of a degree and puts at risk those w ho may "
eventually depend upon our students' knowledge and integrity.  
"Examples of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to:  • cheating on an exam  "
• copying the homework of someone else  
• submitting for credit work done by someone else (include plagiarism and 
"paraphrasing without citing sources , and use of AI ) "
• stealing examinations or course materials  
"• tampering with the University's grade records, or with another student's "
work 
• knowingly and intentionally assisting another student in any of the a bove 
"If you are unsure of whether or not academic misconduct has occurred, the "
Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards is available for a 
"consultation, which may involve reviewing student -submitted material or the "
situation to determine if it vio lates any aspect of the code and if a complaint 
should be submitted.  
Student Religious Accommodations  
Please communicate with me regarding any religious accommodations and 
absences. Below is Portland State University’s Student Religious Accommodations 
policy: 
"If a student requests a religious accommodation, the instructor and student can "
work  
collaboratively to determine a reasonable solution that meets the need of the 
"student, while  "
maintaining the learning objectives of the course. If the student and in structor 
are not able to  
"agree on an appropriate solution, the CARE Team case manager, in the Office "
of the Dean of  
"Student Life, can be assist with an interactive process to determine the "
appropriate solution  
that meets the criteria described within PSU Religious Accommodation Policy . 
Please check  
the religious observance academic calendar  when scheduling events and exams 
to attempt  
to avoid scheduling on the days of religious observance.  
Accommodations for Students  
Please communicate w ith me regarding any accommodations that can be made 
"to support your learning. Further resources available to students including the Disability Resource Center, Resource Center for Students with Children, the "
Queer Resource Center and more can be found at https://www.pdx.edu/dean -

from class before absences begin to affect your grade . On top of all the  things 
"that can make attendance difficult, we’re in a pandemic. If you need to miss "
class for any reason let me know prior to missing class. It’s your responsibility 
to keep up with readings and assignments. If you’re going to miss class 
communicate with me so we can figure out the best course of action to keep 
you on track in class.  
*If you want to attend an event (including protests) I will count it as an

Spring  Quarter: 0 4/01/24- 06/14/24 
Attendance:  
We’re are (still) in a pandemic  and while I want you to take care of yourselves 
"and your community , attending class is an important part of learning and "
engaging with our community. Each student ha s two (2) unexcused absences 
from class before absences begin to affect your grade . On top of all the  things 
"that can make attendance difficult, we’re in a pandemic. If you need to miss "
class for any reason let me know prior to missing class. It’s your responsibility 
to keep up with readings and assignments. If you’re going to miss class 
communicate with me so we can figure out the best course of action to keep 
you on track in class.  
*If you want to attend an event (including protests) I will count it as an 
excused absence if you write a 1 -page paper (minimum 250 words) about your 
experience and how it re lates to the class. This paper is due the following 
week. Please communicate with me prior to the event to work out the details.  
Email Etiquette:   
"When corresponding by e -mail, please do so in a professional manner. This "
"means having an opening (e.g., “Hello Molly”) and a closing that identifies who "
"you are (“Sincerely, Larry Mlynarek”). When emailing, please put “WS -381” in the "
subject line.  I will respond to emails within 24hrs. Please also note that I may 
not check my email in the evenings or weekends so if you need to 
"discuss/notify/or meet with me, please don’t email me at the last minute. If I "
don’t respond within 24hrs then feel free to email m e again.   
Electronic Etiquette :  
"I am not here to police you. I ask that you please not use cell phones, "
"tablets, etc., in class. Please silence and put away cell phones for the duration "
"of class. You are all adults and are responsible for your own educat ion, but it "
goes without saying that constantly looking at your phone during class will affect 
your ability to participate and that will affect your grade.  Assignments:  
"• All papers must use Times New Roman font, 12 -point, double -spaced, 1-"
"inch margins,  "
"with all references cited using Chicago, MLA, or APA citation style. Please "
make sure your papers have been edited for spelling and grammar  
• I have flexibility regarding late assignments. For late assignments  you’ll 
lose 1% per day that the assignment is l ate. 1-week late (7 days) = -7% 
"2-weeks late (14 days) = -14%, etc. If you want to avoid losing points "
you must communicate with me regarding your late/missing assignments.  
• You are still responsible for turning in assignments on days you are 
absent. 
Gradin g: 
• Attendance and Participation 25% (15% main session; 10% mentor session)  
• Entry Tickets 20 % 
• Pebblepad 5%  
• Jason Washington - ‘Beyond Bystander’  Event 5%

• Final 25% 
"Attendance & Participation 25% (15% main session, 10% mentor session)  - “Nobody "
"knows everything, together we know a lot.” My learning and teaching style "
involves in-depth discussion and participation. We learn in community with each 
other. Some of the texts we’ll be reading and discussing will be difficult and 
thus attendance in class is necessary. Participation can look like many different 
"things: participating in small group discussion, speaking in class, engaged "
"listening, respecting others who are speaking (not on your phone or laptop), ice "
"breaker prompts, etc.  "
Entry/Exit Tickets 20% - At the start of each class students will have 10min to fill 
out an entry ticket. A different entry prompt will be given each day. It is your 
responsibility to fill out and turn in your entry. I will provide a small notebook 
that will be passed out and picked up. Entry tickets are due the day of and 
cannot be turn ed in late. Entry tickets will be adjusted for cancelled classes.  
Each ticket is worth 2 . You will receive 1 point for a basic response that do es 
not reference class readings or themes. You will receive 2 points for a 
thoughtful response that references class readings and themes. You are allowed 
to miss 2 entry tickets without it affecting your grade.  Pebblepad 5%  
"Everyone will share a link to the ir pebblepad site. Each site should have a bio, "
and at least 4 assignments that have been uploaded. Last quarter we built out 
our pebblepad and this quarter we will do it again.  
Jason Washington Event 5%

Washington Event on June 6th. It’s the last day of class and you must attend

More detail about paper requirements will be given in a separate document.  
***Extra Credit***  
This quarter we’re focusing on Social Justice/Activism. If you would like extra 
"credit, you can attend an act ivist/social justice event and write me 500 -word "
paper (1-page single spaced/2 -page double spaces) about the event. You can do 
this up to three (3) times in the class.

Spring  Quarter: 0 4/01/24- 06/14/24 
Attendance:  
We’re are (still) in a pandemic  and while I want you to take care of yourselves 
"and your community , attending class is an important part of learning and "
engaging with our community. Each student ha s two (2) unexcused absences 
from class before absences begin to affect your grade . On top of all the  things 
"that can make attendance difficult, we’re in a pandemic. If you need to miss "
class for any reason let me know prior to missing class. It’s your responsibility 
to keep up with readings and assignments. If you’re going to miss class 
communicate with me so we can figure out the best course of action to keep 
you on track in class.  
*If you want to attend an event (including protests) I will count it as an 
excused absence if you write a 1 -page paper (minimum 250 words) about your 
experience and how it re lates to the class. This paper is due the following 
week. Please communicate with me prior to the event to work out the details.  
Email Etiquette:   
"When corresponding by e -mail, please do so in a professional manner. This "
"means having an opening (e.g., “Hello Molly”) and a closing that identifies who "
"you are (“Sincerely, Larry Mlynarek”). When emailing, please put “WS -381” in the "
subject line.  I will respond to emails within 24hrs. Please also note that I may 
not check my email in the evenings or weekends so if you need to 
"discuss/notify/or meet with me, please don’t email me at the last minute. If I "
don’t respond within 24hrs then feel free to email m e again.   
Electronic Etiquette :  
"I am not here to police you. I ask that you please not use cell phones, "
"tablets, etc., in class. Please silence and put away cell phones for the duration "
"of class. You are all adults and are responsible for your own educat ion, but it "
goes without saying that constantly looking at your phone during class will affect 
your ability to participate and that will affect your grade.  Assignments:  
"• All papers must use Times New Roman font, 12 -point, double -spaced, 1-"
"inch margins,  "
"with all references cited using Chicago, MLA, or APA citation style. Please "
make sure your papers have been edited for spelling and grammar  
• I have flexibility regarding late assignments. For late assignments  you’ll 
lose 1% per day that the assignment is l ate. 1-week late (7 days) = -7% 
"2-weeks late (14 days) = -14%, etc. If you want to avoid losing points "
you must communicate with me regarding your late/missing assignments.  
• You are still responsible for turning in assignments on days you are 
absent. 
Gradin g: 
• Attendance and Participation 25% (15% main session; 10% mentor session)  
• Entry Tickets 20 % 
• Pebblepad 5%  
• Jason Washington - ‘Beyond Bystander’  Event 5% 
• Class Reflection  10% 
• Final 25% 
"Attendance & Participation 25% (15% main session, 10% mentor session)  - “Nobody "
"knows everything, together we know a lot.” My learning and teaching style "
involves in-depth discussion and participation. We learn in community with each 
other. Some of the texts we’ll be reading and discussing will be difficult and 
thus attendance in class is necessary. Participation can look like many different 
"things: participating in small group discussion, speaking in class, engaged "
"listening, respecting others who are speaking (not on your phone or laptop), ice "
"breaker prompts, etc.  "
Entry/Exit Tickets 20% - At the start of each class students will have 10min to fill 
out an entry ticket. A different entry prompt will be given each day. It is your 
responsibility to fill out and turn in your entry. I will provide a small notebook 
that will be passed out and picked up. Entry tickets are due the day of and 
cannot be turn ed in late. Entry tickets will be adjusted for cancelled classes.  
Each ticket is worth 2 . You will receive 1 point for a basic response that do es 
not reference class readings or themes. You will receive 2 points for a 
thoughtful response that references class readings and themes. You are allowed 
to miss 2 entry tickets without it affecting your grade.  Pebblepad 5%  
"Everyone will share a link to the ir pebblepad site. Each site should have a bio, "
and at least 4 assignments that have been uploaded. Last quarter we built out 
our pebblepad and this quarter we will do it again.  
Jason Washington Event 5%  
As part of our focus on social justice and activism  we will attend the Jason 
Washington Event on June 6th. It’s the last day of class and you must attend 
the event for our class time.  
Class  Reflection 10%- Your class reflection is an opportunity to reflect on the 
class over the past 3 quarters. A prompt will be shared later in the course.  
Final 25% - TBA 
More detail about paper requirements will be given in a separate document.  
***Extra Credit***  
This quarter we’re focusing on Social Justice/Activism. If you would like extra 
"credit, you can attend an act ivist/social justice event and write me 500 -word "
paper (1-page single spaced/2 -page double spaces) about the event. You can do 
this up to three (3) times in the class.  
Grading Scale:  
The following will be the grading scale: A = 94 -100 %; A- = 90-93%; B+ = 
87-89%; B = 84 -86%; B- = 80-83%; C+ = 77 -79%; C = 74 -76%; C- = 70-73%;

Course Description  
Fresh Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a 
particular theme (Portland) from an 
"interdisciplinary  perspective.  In this course, we "
will use the city of Portland to uncover how the 
"place we live in shapes our lives, and how we, in "
"turn, shape the pl aces. We will examine the city as "
a context for human development and cultural 
expression; as an urban area of diverse 
"communities; as part of the larger natural, material, "
and social environment of the Pacific Northwest; 
"as a political, economic, and cult ural entity within "
the United States of America; and as a site of 
global capitalist production. We will discuss what 
connects us to our place(s) as well as what makes 
"place(s) part of our social, cultural, spiritual, "
"economic and political life.  We will r ead broadly, "
touching on multiple disciplines and perspectives. 
We will use the city as our laboratory as we 
explore the communities and spaces of greater 
Portland.  
Course Outcomes/Learning Objectives  
The Four University Studies Learning Goals:  
"University Studies courses focus on four main learning goals.  Throughout this course, you will "
develop your skills in these areas:

Page 2 of 7 Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various 
"ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and other v isual and oral means —to collaborate "
"effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication "
technologies.  
Critical Thinking and Inquiry: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —proble m-posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to "
"become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
"Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and  contemporary settings from "
multiple perspectives.  
"Ethics, Agency and Community: Students will examine values, theories and practices "
"that inform their actions, and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact "
local and global communities.  
UNST Mission:  
"Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry -based pedagogy:  "
• provokes students to build self -efficacy through relational learning across 
difference  
• encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for 
transformative learnin g 
"• advances civic engagement, reflective practice, and the scholarship of "
teaching and learning  
"UNST Vision : Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously "

Google Drive  (for all course materials) :  
I use Google Drive  for our Learning Management System. You will find everything you need in 
"our Class Drive … daily class documents, readings, resources, etc. Each of you will have your "
"own turn -in folder where you will, as the name suggests, turn in all your work. This material is "
not to be shared outside of ou r class community. Talk to me if you have any questions or 
concerns about use of the Drive.  
Grading Criteria  
I have structured the course in an intentiona l fashion in order to create a vibrant and supportive 
learning community and foster student agency in claiming your education. Students will be 
deeply involved in assessing their performance and learning over the course of the term and 
selecting their grad e. Course assignments will encourage a reflective learning practice that 
facilitates a deeper processing of course concepts and which encourages connection to real world 
"issues. This structure is reflective of a commitment to the values of democracy, horiz ontalism in "
"the classroom, decentralization, interdisciplinarity, and a rich form of participation, which I hope "
will provide for a dynamic learning experience . 
In line with the aim of taking agency over your education you will determine your own grade at 
"the end of term, with input from the mentor and I. Along the way, I’ll offer you qualitative "
"feedback on your assignments and at the end of the term, you will wr ite a reflection on your "
work that assesses your own performance during the term and documents your growth on the 4 
UNST goals.  
I am much more interested in your learning than in the grade I enter for you at the end of the 
"term. By remaining in this cours e, you agree to the conditions set forth here, including the course "
requirements and the terms for self -assessment  outlined above.   
Flexibility Statement  
The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and/or substitute assignments and 
"learning  activities in response to institutional, weather, or class situations.   "

Course Attendance  
• You are required to attend all Main Class Sessions and Mentor Sessions.  
• You must also arrive promptly and stay the whole time.  
• Everyone starts the term with 4 attendance points. Each main class  and each 
mentor session you miss costs 1 point.

"• If you are sick, you should stay home!  That’s what the points are for . "
• Don’t squander your points on unnecessary absences.  
• Other conditions requi ring longer absence require an individual 
agreement to modify this policy.   
Page 5 of 7 • If you miss more than a third of a main or mentor session by being tardy or 
leaving early you forfeit .5 point.  
"• If you have zero points at the end, attendance points will not af fect your grade.  "
"• Your grade will be affected, positively or negatively, if you have more or less "
than zero attendance points.  
• Consult the daily agenda and make arrangements to get notes and materials from 
a classmate and when you must miss class.

Office hours/location:  CH 117  
"Mon/ Wed  8-8:45 AM, 1:30 -2:00 PM  "
Course Description:  
Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is the city of Portland) from an 
"interdisciplinary  (incorporating two or more types of knowledge)  perspective.  In this course, we will use the city "
"of Portland to uncover how place shapes our lives, and how we, in turn, shape the places we live in.  We will "
examine the city as a context for human develop ment and cultural expression; as an urban area of diverse 
"communities; and as part of the larger natural, material, and social environment of the Pacific Northwest.  We "
"will discuss what connects people to their place(s) as well as what makes their place(s ) part of their social, "
"cultural, spiritual, economic and political life.  We will read broadly, touching on the social sciences (urban "
"studies, sociology, and political science) and humanities (history, literature, arts).  We will use the city as our "
labo ratory as we explore the communities and spaces of greater Portland.  
Course Objectives:  
"Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, graphics, "
"numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectiv ely with others in group work, and to be "
competent in appropriate communication technologies.  
Critical Thinking and Inquiry : Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula —
"problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, and empowered "
learners.  
"Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social "
justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspec tives.  
"Ethics, Agency, and Community: Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, "
and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.  
Course Learning Outcomes  
"As a result of this  course, students will be able to:  "
" 2 • Analyze the various political, geological, economic, and social factors that help shape Portland.  "
• Examine various factors that lead to both a “sense of place” and to displacement.  
"• Recognize the importance of equity as we explore Portland as a city, and the significance of a "
multidisciplinary approach to investigating the city.  
• Develop inquiry and critical thinking skills that help us address important social issues.  
"• Use evidence as a means to deepen understanding of an  issue, solve problems, discover new ideas, "
"develop perspective on a topic, and/or effectively convey a point of view to others.  "
"• Develop skills of observation, civic engagement, dialogue, and analysis; practice being a deep listener.   "
"• Make use of the writ ing process, including brainstorming, drafting, workshopping, revising, editing, and "
proofreading work.  
"• Find, evaluate, synthesize, and analyze a variety of primary and secondary sources, and use appropriate "
means of documentation for those sources.  
"• Synt hesize materials, developing your own perspective as you integrate your own ideas and experiences "
with those of others.  
Course Policies:  
"In this course, we will engage in inquiry -based learning. Unlike traditional modes of learning where the "
"instructor p resents information and students are tested on their ability to retain or understand that information, "
an inquiry -based classroom focuses on exploring ideas and concepts through discussion or other participatory 
activities. This style of education requires  student engagement and active participation. Our goal is to create a 
community of teachers and learners where everyone’s unique perspectives and experiences help broaden our 
collective understanding of key ideas and concepts.  
"For this type of learning to  work well, everyone has to participate and be involved. The following course policies "
are designed to facilitate inquiry -based learning:  
Participation:  
"Please come to class on time, prepared (with books or assignments, a notebook, and pen) and ready to  "
"participate. In this class, we will be engaged in discussions and other forms of active learning where every "
"student’s contribution matters. Your questions, insights, and ideas will help us build our collective knowledge "
base. If you are in class and are not engaged (listening and paying attention even if you choose not to speak) 
"and/or are disruptive, you may not receive credit for that day’s work.  "
Electronics:  
"Research shows that even when laptops or tablets are being used for an academic purpose, they can distract "
"from class discussions. No laptop, tablet, cell phone, and ear bud use permitted during class time. You will have "
"a break in the middle of class wher e you can check your phone or listen to music. But while class is in session, "
you should put your electronics away. We will occasionally have class activities that require computers. During 
"those activities, you may use your laptop or cell phone to conduct  research. You can also use a computer in the "
mentor lab. I will let you know when the use of personal electronics is permitted.  
Assignments/Late work:  
“Finished crap can be edited. Unfinished greatness languishes forever” ― Margarita Gakis  
"In other words, get it done, and get it done on time!  I don’t accept late work.  In most cases, students who turn -"
in late work don’t turn in any higher quality work than those who turn their work in by the due date.  Part of our 
learning this year is figu ring out how to prioritize work and how to effectively manage your time.  
  3 Let’s Talk  
"No matter how much time and effort you devote to your schoolwork, sometimes life just gets in the way. If "
"something unexpected comes up that prevents you from attending class or completing an assignment, please "
"come and talk to me. If you find yourself struggling to stay motivated or to get work done, let’s chat. If you don’t "
"understand an assignment or can’t make sense of a reading, let me know. FRINQ courses are designe d to be "
supportive. Our goal is to help you develop the skills you will need to be successful in higher education. We 
"don’t expect you to be a stellar college student right away, but we also won’t necessarily know that you are "
struggling if you don’t talk to us.  
Your mentor and I are both available to talk to you. You can chat with us before or after main or mentor sessions 
or during the class break. I also hold regular office hours. Feel free to drop in during my office hours or make an 
appointment if th ose hours don’t work for you. You can also send me an email. I make an effort to promptly 
(within 24 hours on weekdays) respond to email.  
"If you have a question about course assignments or grades, come talk to me. If you need support in this or any "
"of yo ur other classes, you might chat with your mentor. Mentors are trained to help students navigate campus "
"resources. But don’t worry about who to go to with which question. If your mentor or I don’t have an answer, "
"we will refer you to someone who does. So, if you have questions or need some support, just reach out to either "
one of us. That’s what we are here for.  
Grading:  
Attendance/Participation: Attendance will be taken in both main and mentor sessions.  
If you…  Attendance/Participation Grade

Google Drive  (for all course materials) :  
I use Google Drive  for our Learning Management System. You will find everything you need in 
"our Class Drive … daily class documents, readings, resources, etc. Each of you will have your "
"own turn -in folder where you will, as the name suggests, turn in all your work. This material is "
not to be shared outside of ou r class community. Talk to me if you have any questions or 
concerns about use of the Drive.  
Grading Criteria  
I have structured the course in an intentiona l fashion in order to create a vibrant and supportive 
learning community and foster student agency in claiming your education. Students will be 
deeply involved in assessing their performance and learning over the course of the term and 
selecting their grad e. Course assignments will encourage a reflective learning practice that 
facilitates a deeper processing of course concepts and which encourages connection to real world 
"issues. This structure is reflective of a commitment to the values of democracy, horiz ontalism in "
"the classroom, decentralization, interdisciplinarity, and a rich form of participation, which I hope "
will provide for a dynamic learning experience . 
In line with the aim of taking agency over your education you will determine your own grade at 
"the end of term, with input from the mentor and I. Along the way, I’ll offer you qualitative "
"feedback on your assignments and at the end of the term, you will write a reflection on your "
work that assesses your own performance during the term and documents your growth on the 4 
UNST goals.  
I am much more interested in your learning than in the grade I enter for you at the end of the 
"term. By remaining in this course, you agree to the conditions set forth here, including the course "
requirements and the terms for self -assessment  outlined above.

Course Description  
Fresh Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a 
particular theme (Portland) from an 
"interdisciplinary  perspective.  In this course, we "
will use the city of Portland to uncover how the 
"place we live in shapes our lives, and how we, in "
"turn, shape the places. We will examine the city as "
a context for human development and cultural 
expression; as an urban ar ea of diverse 
"communities; as part of the larger natural, material, "
and social environment of the Pacific Northwest; 
"as a political, economic, and cultural entity within "
the United States of America; and as a site of 
global capitalist production. We will d iscuss what 
connects us to our place(s) as well as what makes 
"place(s) part of our social, cultural, spiritual, "
"economic and political life.  We will read broadly, "
touching on multiple disciplines and perspectives. 
We will use the city as our laboratory as  we 
explore the communities and spaces of greater 
Portland.  
Course Outcomes/Learning Objectives

UNST 11 3A: On Democracy (Reimagining Democracy)   
"Freshman Inquiry, Spring  2024 "
Monday/Wednesday 9:00 AM -10:50 AM    Cramer Hall 103/  Cramer Hall 250 
Instructor: Dr. Leanne Serbulo      Mentor: Marvin Leon  
Contact: serbulo@pdx.edu      Contact: marvleon@pdx.edu  
Office hours/location: CH 117  
"Mon/Wed 8:00 -8:50, 1:30 -2:00 or by arrangement  "
Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is Reimagining Democracy) 
"from an interdisciplinary  (incorporating two or more types of knowledge)  perspective. In this course, we "
"will explore how democracy functions and evaluate its relevance in our time of political, economic, and "
"environmental crisis. We will examine how the rise of digital media, pol arization and extremism, and "
political paralysis in response to existential issues like climate change pose critical challenges to 
democratic norms and ideals. We will consider how individual and societal interventions such as media 
"literacy, atrocity prev ention efforts, community building, and protest movements can address these "
fundamental challenges to democracy. Students will design and participate in community -based learning 
activities that increase civic engagement and address large -scale social and e cological issues.  
UNST Program Goals:  
"• Communication:  Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, "
"graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in "
"group work, and to be competent  in appropriate communication technologies.  "
• Critical Thinking and Inquiry:  Students will learn various modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become "
"active, self -motivated, and empowe red learners.  "
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice:  Students will explore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple "
perspectives.  
"• Ethics, Agency, and Community:  Students wil l examine values, theories and practices that inform "
"their actions, and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global "
communities.  
Course Learning Objectives : 
1. Define the key characteristics of a democratic society.  
2. Critically  examine the role that information and disinformation play in fostering a healthy 
democracy and creating an engaged and active populace.  
3. Evaluate how effectively democratic practices adhere to stated ideals.  
4. Apply lessons from historical events and process es to understand the challenges democracies face 
today.  
5. Understand how your own actions can contribute to strengthening democracy.  
"6. Practice communicating across difference and having meaningful, civil dialogues on challenging "
topics.  
Required Materials:  
Assigned readings will be posted in our course Canvas shell . 
Course Policies:  
"In this course, we will engage in inquiry -based learning. Unlike traditional modes of learning where the "
instructor presents information and students are tested on their ability  to retain or understand that 
"information, an inquiry -based classroom focuses on exploring ideas and concepts through discussion or "
other participatory activities. This style of education requires student engagement and active participation. 
Our goal is to  create a community of teachers and learners where everyone ’s unique perspectives and 
experiences help broaden our collective understanding of key ideas and concepts.  
"For this type of learning to work well, everyone has to participate and be involved. The  following course "
policies are designed to facilitate inquiry -based learning:  
Participation:  
"Please come to class on time , prepared (with books or assignments, a notebook, and pen)  and ready  to "
"participate. In this class, we will be engaged in discussion s and other forms of active learning where every "
"student ’s contribution matters. Your questions, insights, and ideas will help us build our collective "
knowledge base. If you are in class and are not engaged (listening and paying attention even if you choos e 
"not to speak)  and/or are disruptive, you may not receive credit for that day ’s work.  "
Electronics:  
"Research shows that even when laptops or tablets are being used for an academic purpose, they can "
"distract from class discussions. No laptop, tablet, cell phone , and ear bud use permitted during class "
time. You will have a break in the middle of class where you can check your phone or listen to music. But 
"while class is in session, you should put your electronics away. We will occasiona lly have class activities "
"that require computers. During those activities, you may use your laptop or cell phone to conduct "
research. You can also use a computer in the mentor lab. I will let you know when the use of personal 
electronics is permitted.  
Assignments/Late work:

"In other words, get it done, and get it done on time!  I don ’t acce pt late work.  In most cases, students who "

Let’s Talk  
"No matter how much time and effort you devote to your schoolwork, sometimes life just gets in the way. "
"If something unexpected comes up that prevents you from attending class or completing an assignment, please come and talk to me. If you find yourself struggling to stay motivated or to get work done, let ’s "
"chat. If you don ’t understand an assignment or can ’t make sense of a reading, let me know. FRINQ "
courses are designed to be supportive. Our goal is to help you develop the skills you will need to be 
"successful in higher education. We don ’t expect you to be a stellar college student right away, but we also "

Your mentor and I are both  available to talk to you. You can chat with us before or after main or mentor 
sessions or during the class break. I also hold regular office hours. Feel free to drop in during my office

Course Description  
Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is Reimagining 
Democracy) from an interdisciplinary  (incorporating two or more types of knowledge)  
"perspective. In this course, we will explore how democracy functions and evaluate its relevance "
"in our time of political, economic, and environmental crisis. We will examine how the rise of "
"digital media, pol arization and extremism, and political paralysis in response to existential issues "
like climate change pose critical challenges to democratic norms and ideals. We will consider 
"how individual and societal interventions such as media literacy, atrocity prev ention efforts, "
"community building, and protest movements can address these fundamental challenges to "
democracy. Students will design and participate in community -based learning activities that 
increase civic engagement and address large -scale social and e cological issues . 
UNST Program Goals  
"University Studies courses focus on four main learning goals.  Throughout this course, you will "
develop your skills in these areas:  
• Communication:  Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —
"writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with "
"others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
• Critical Thinking and Inquiry:  Students will learn various modes of inqui ry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to "
"become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice:  Students will explore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from "
multiple perspectives.  
"• Ethics, Agency, and Community:  Students will examine values, theories and practices that "
"inform their actions, and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact local "
and global communities.  
Course Learning Objectives (Fall Term)   
Page 2 of 9 1. Define the key characteristics of a democratic society.  
2. Critically examine the role that information and disinformation play in fostering a healthy 
democracy and creating  an engaged and active populace.  
3. Evaluate how effectively democratic practices adhere to stated ideals.  
4. Apply lessons from historical events and processes to understand the challenges 
democracies face today.  
5. Understand how your own actions can contribute t o strengthening democracy.  
"6. Practice communicating across difference and having meaningful, civil dialogues on "
challenging topics.  
Required Materials:  
There are no required texts for this course. Texts will be provided as online links or attachments 
in our Canvas shell . 
Course Policies:  
"In this course, we will engage in inquiry -based learning. Unlike traditional learning where the "
instructor presents information and students are tested on their ability to retain or understand that 
"information, an inquiry -based classroom focuses on exploring ideas and concepts through "
discussion or other participatory activities. This style of education requires student engagement 
and active participation. Our goal is to create a community of teachers and learners where 
every one’s unique perspectives and experiences help broaden our collective understanding of 
key ideas and concepts.  
"For this type of learning to work well, everyone has to participate and be involved. The "
following course policies are designed to facilitate i nquiry -based learning:  
Participatio n 
"Please come to class on time, prepared (with books or assignments, a notebook, and pen) "
"and ready to participate. In this class, we will be engaged in discussions and other forms "
"of active learning where every student’ s contribution matters. Your questions, insights, "
and ideas will help us build our collective knowledge base. If you are in class and are not 
engaged (listening and paying attention even if you choose not to speak) and/or are 
"disruptive, you may not receive credit for that day’s work.  "
Electronic s 
Research s hows that even when laptops or tablets are being used for an academic 
"purpose, they can distract from class discussions. No laptop, tablet, cell phone, and ear "
bud use permitted during class time. You will have a break in the middle of class where 
"you can check your phone or listen to music. But while class is in session, you should put "
your electronics away. We will occasionally have class activities that require computers. 
"During those activities,  you may use your laptop or cell phone to conduct research. You "
can also use a computer in the mentor lab. I will let you know when the use of personal 
electronics is permitted.  
Assignments/Late Work 
“Finished crap  can be edited. Unfinished greatness languishes forever” ― Margarita Gakis   
"Page 3 of 9 In other words, get it done, and get it done on time! I don’t accept late work. In most "
"cases, students who turn -in late work don’t turn in any higher quality work than those "
who turn their work in by the due date. Part of our learning this year is figurin g out how 
to prioritize work and how to effectively manage your time.  
Let’s Talk  
"No matter how much time and effort you devote to your schoolwork, sometimes life just "
gets in the way. If something unexpected comes up that prevents you from attending clas s

"or can’t make sense of a reading, let me know. FRINQ courses are designed to  be "
supportive. Our goal is to help you develop the skills you will need to be successful in

Course Description  
Freshman Inquiry  (FRINQ)  is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is Reimagining Democracy) from an interdisciplinary  
"(incorporating two or more types of knowled ge) perspective.  In this course, we will explore how democracy functions and evaluate its relevance in "
"Page 2 of 11 our time of political, economic, and environmental crisis. We will examine how the rise of digital media, polarization and ex tremism, and political "
"paral ysis in response to existential issues like climate change, pose critical challenges to democratic norms and ideals. We will consider how "
"individual and societal interventions such as media literacy, atrocity prevention efforts, community building, and pro test movements can address "
these fundamental challenges to democracy. Students will design and participate in community -based learning activities that increase civic 
engagement and address large -scale social and ecological issues.  
This course is:  
"Writing Intensive  – We will be doing lots of writing, both in and out of class. Much of the writing will be low -stakes, generative and reflective: a "
"way to process what you’re learning and generate ideas for discussion and assignments. Some of it will be high stak es, edited and polished.  "
Discussion -based  – Much of what and how you learn will take place from participating in discussions with your classmates. This is not a class wh ere 
you study facts and take a test to see how well you memorized them. We are creating  knowledge together by talking about and creating ideas.  
"Experiential  – In addition to learning about democracy and democratic principles, we will be practicing those principles in our activities a nd "
assignments. We aren’t just reading about democracy; we’ re going to “do” democracy too.

Flexibility Statement  
The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and/or substitute assignments and learning activities in response to 
"institutional, weather, or class situations.  "
Course Attendance and Make -up Policies  
Participation:  
"Please come to class on time , prepared (with books or assignments, a notebook, and pen)  and ready  to participate  (having read the texts for that "
"day, and done any reading responses or homework) . In this class, we will be engaged in discussions and other forms of active learning where every "
"student’s contribution matters. Your questions, insights, and ideas will help  us build our collective knowledge base. If you are in class and are not "
"participating and/or are disruptive, you will not receive credit for that day’s work.  "
Technology etiquette: To foster a positive environment that is free of distractions there is a zero -tolerance cell phone and earbud policy. We expect 
"all phones to be turned off and put away during all class sessions  and no use of headphones or earbuds,  including mentor labs. Connection and "
"collaboration are essential for learning. Research shows th at even when laptops or tablets are being used for an academic purpose, they can "
"distract from class discussions. Please do not use laptops, tablets, or cell phones during class  unless the professor or mentor has explicitly "
instructed you to do so.  
Assignments/Late work:  
This term ALL WORK IS DUE BY MIDNIGHT OF THE DUE DATE.  I won’t accept late work without  prior arrangement. Part of your learning this year is 
"figuring out how to prioritize your work and how to effectively manage your time. In addit ion, accepting late work by some isn’t fair to students "
"who make an effort to get things done on time , nor to your instructor .  Exceptions and accommodations must be discussed with instructor in "
advance.  
Page 7 of 11 Let’s Talk  
"No matter how much time and effort you d evote to your schoolwork, sometimes life just gets in the way.  If something unexpected comes up that "
"prevents you from attending class or completing an assignment,  please come and talk to me. If you find yourself struggling to stay motivated or to "
"get work  done, let’s  chat. If you don’t understand an assignment or can’t make sense of a reading, let me know. FRINQ  courses are designed to be "
supportive. Our goal is to help you develop the skills you will need to be  successful in higher education. We don’t exp ect you to be a stellar college 
"student right away, but we also  won’t necessarily know that you are struggling if you don’t talk to us.  Your mentor and I are both available to talk to "
you. You can chat with us before or after main or mentor  sessions or dur ing the class break. I also hold regular student drop -in hours. Feel free to 
drop in  during those or make an appointment if those hours don’t work for you. You can also send me an email. I make  an effort to promptly  
"(within 24 hours on weekdays) respond to  email.  If you have a question about course assignments or grades, come talk to me. If you need support "
"in this or  any of your other classes, you might chat with your mentor. Mentors are trained to help students navigate  campus resources. But don’t "
"worry a bout who to go to with which question. If your mentor or I don’t  have an answer, we will refer you someone who does. So, if you have "
"questions or need some support,  just reach out to either one of us. That’s what we are here for.  "

D = Work shows effort but does not meet assignment requirements in some way(s).  
"F = Work is not submitted , is very minimal, and/or is far off -assignment.  "
Online Course Format:   
"This is a  mostly  asynchronous online course , meaning  we will (usually) not meet together at a "
"certain time. Our course is located on Canvas, which you can access using your ODIN login. You "
can find a link to Canvas on PSU’s  I Am a Student  page. Though  you will manage your own 
"schedule, there will be due dates (see policies  below).  "
Our service -learning component may require participation at scheduled meetings  in person or by 
Zoom . Groups will work together to determine specific requirements while cons idering group 
members’ needs and constraints.  
"While there are no  formal office hours, Dave and I are happy meet with you by appointment  by "
Zoom .  
Weekly Discussion Forums  Policies : 
"Read carefully : this is different from UNST 117 and 118. To reduce overwork, this course requires "
"completion of only six (6) out of ten (10) weeks of discussion forum content, distributed as "
follows:  
• Week 1: Everyone must complete . 
• Weeks 2 -9: Choose four (4) out of the eight (8) options to complete . 
• Week 10: Everyone mus t complete . 
"Since this is an online asynchronous class, it is vital that everyone participate fully and promptly "
on our course site. Discussion is graded on a complete/incomplete basis  with deductions for 
lateness as follows:  
All parts are completed and on time:    100%  
All parts are completed but some or  
all are up to  one (1) week late:    90%  
All parts are completed but some or  
all are more than  one (1) week late:    80% 
The assignment is not submitted  or  
not all parts are  completed by the final due date:  0%  4 
There will be two final due dates for forums during the term . Work not completed by these dates 
will receive a permanent 0 : 
"• Forums for Weeks 1 -5: final due date is Sunday  of Week 6 (May 12, 2024 ) "
"• Forums for Weeks 6 -10: final due date is Wednesday  of Week 11  (June 12, 2024 ). "
Week  2-9 are scored as follow s:  
"I will record  scores with in a few days of the due date. If posts are  complete, the forum  will "
"receive full -points or “complete” ( ). If posts have been started but  not completed, it will "
"receive an “incomplete” (X).  If no posts have been made, I will select “excused” for the first "
"four (4) such weeks. After four (4) weeks have been “excused,” any further forums that are "
incomplete will receive an “incomplete” (X).  
"If you planned  to complete a certain forum and were simply late submitting  it, email me or "
"message me through your Canvas inbox (not assignment comments) , and let me know. I will "
be glad to remove the “excused” and grade your late work.  
"Canvas due dates : Canvas can only list one due date per forum, so it cannot remind you of both "
due dates for initial posts and replies. Setting the due date for the initial posts is usually more 
"helpful for students, but that means you must remember replies ! "
"Respectful Co nduct : We will develop class norms as guidelines for having excellent, productive "
"conversations. In broad terms, be respectful and support each other’s learning. Remember, "
there is a real person behind the screen. In the unlikely event that a student is significantly 
"disruptive, they may be reported to the Office of the Dean of Student Life.  "
Service -Learning Planning and Participation Policies:  
Requirements for participation in service -learning planning  will be outlined in the “Introduction” 
"item for ea ch week. Planning will take place in your group’s service -learning discussion forum, "
unless the group chooses an alternate method (like Discord). Planning will have two goals:  
"a. planning the logistics of the service activity itself ,  "
b. determining who will pr oduce which rhetorical output  (type of communication)  
Participating in planning each of these two goals will be worth 5 points for a total of 10 points. 
Full credit will be given for active and prompt participation that moves the group forward to its 
goals. Partial credit is available. Students who do not participate in planning will have decisions 
"made for them , including scheduling of activities they may  be expected  to attend.  "
  5 
Students will receive full credit for participating  in the service activity i tself if they actively and 
"respectfully participate in  the expected work: ex. helping maintain paths, participating in a "
"deliberative discussion, taking suicide prevention training. Students who miss a scheduled "
"activity must reach out to Arwen or Dave abo ut an alternative, which, at the instructor’s "
"discretion, may receive only partial credit, depending on the specific  circumstances . "
Late Work Policy for Major Assignments  
"Except for the discussion forums  and service planning/participation , described above , the late "
work policy is as follows:  
Assignment is up to one (1) week late:    -10%  
Assignment is more than one (1) week late:   -20%  
"Work will be accepted for late credit up to Sunday  of Week 1 0. At my discretion, I may give a "
small extension  beyond this  on a case -by-case basis . 
Extensions on Work:  
"If you need an extension of up to a few days on an assignment, message me to explain what "
additional time you need at least 24 hours before the assignment is due . We will then agree 
"on a new due da te. If the work is not submitted by the date we agree on, late penalties will "
be assessed based on the extended  due date. This policy is designed to encourage personal 
agency and responsibility in managing workload and due dates.  
Homework Format:  
"Major as signments must be typed, double -spaced using an 11 or 12 -point font, plain face (not "
"bold ), with one -inch margins, unless otherwise specified . "
No Heading Penalty:   
You must put your name on all your work . This is an expectation in most professional writing. 
"A heading  usually states your name, professor's name, class, and date at the top of your "
"paper. To avoid the no heading penalty, you must minimally write your name.  NO HEADING "
PENALTY:  You will lose 0. 5 points if a submitted written assignment does not include a 
"HEADING. Exceptions: discussion forum posts, quizzes, and surveys do not need a heading.   "
Vocabulary: Heading vs. Header : A “heading” includes your name and other identifying 
"information, usually 1 inch down from the top of page  1 only . A “header” is the area in the "
top 1/2 inch of your pages where page numbers go (and sometimes you name as well).   6 
Revision Policy:  
Revising work is vital to a successful writing process. It is expected that you will revise work on 
"your own prior to submission. However, you may further revise and resubmit any final "
"assignment one time  to improve your grade, except the E-Portfolio and Final Reflection , the final "
assignment s of the term . Any late work deductions already assessed will remain. If you wish to 
"revise an assignment, please contact me to discuss your situation. Revisions are due by Sunday  of "
Week 10 .  
Content Statement:  
It is nature of critical inquiry  courses like this one to discuss complex and controversial topics 
"that may make us uncomfortable. In fact, such discomfort is often a sign of productive critical "
thinking and reasoned inquiry into socially important issues.  I encourage you to embrace this 
"discomfort as a part of active learning. In some cases, however, a class member may have "
personal associations with a topic that make the topic distressing in a way that interferes with 
"learning. In such a case, that class member is encouraged to consult with the professor.  "
Withdrawal from the Course:  
"If you need to drop/withdraw from this course, please consult PSU’s Withdrawal, Cancellation, "
and Drops  page.  
Equity and Compliance Statement:  
We commit to equity as a foundation of PSU’s excellence. We define equity as ensuring 
"everyone has access to opportunities necessary to satisfy essential needs, advance their well -"
"being, and achieve their full potential. Our aim is to address the roots of inequities, including but "
"not limited to racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, classism, and the intersections of these "
inequities ( Let Knowledge Serve the City: Strategic Plan 2016 -2020 ). 
"In particular, discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, disability, national origin, race, "
"color, marital status, veteran status, religion, sex, sexual ori entation, genetic information or in "
"the use of Worker's Compensation, Federal Family Medical Leave Act, or the Oregon Medical "
Leave Act is strictly prohibited by  PSU Pro hibited Discrimination & Harassment Policy  and is 
unlawful.  
Access and Inclusion for Students with Disabilities  
"PSU values diversity and inclusion; My goal is to create a learning environment that is accessible, "
"equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. I am committed to fostering mutual respect and full "
participation for all students. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to 
"your inclusion or learning, please notify me. Additionally, the Disability Resource Center (DRC) "
provides re asonable accommodations for students who encounter barriers in the learning 
"environment. The DRC works with students who have physical, learning, cognitive, mental "
"health, sensory, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have, a disability th at may "
"affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact the Disability Resource  7 "
Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable 
"accommodations. If you already have accommodations, please contact me to make sure that I "
have received your faculty notification letter from the DRC so we can discuss your 
accommodations. You can contact the DRC at 503 -725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu or visit the DRC 
online at https://www.pdx.edu/disability -resource -center .

"While PSU does not observe most religious holidays, the university is committed to "
"accommodating any students who have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments, or other "

School / Life Conflict Policy  
"To master the course mate rial and succeed in this class, it will be important for students to keep "
"up with course material class and complete all course assignments in full and on time. However, I "
recognize that many students face obstacles to their education as a result of work o r family 
obligations or unforeseen personal difficulties. If at any point you are experiencing challenges 
"that are impacting your ability to succeed in this course, please reach out to me immediately so "
that we can work together to form a plan for your aca demic success.  
"Sexual Harassment, Violence, and Sex -Based Discrimination Policy:  "
"Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972:  “No person in the United States shall, on the "
"basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to "
discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  
Portland State is c ommitted to providing an environment free of all forms of prohibited 
"discrimination and sexual harassment (sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, and gender "
or sex -based harassment and stalking). If you have experienced any form of gender or sex -based 
"discrimination or harassment, know that help and support are available. PSU has staff members "
"trained to support survivors in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, "
"providing academic and on -housing accommodations, helping wit h legal protective orders, and "

"reporting options, can be found on PSU’s Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response website "
at: http://www.pdx.edu/sexual - assault/g et-help or you may call a confidential IPV Advocate at 
503-894-7982. Please be aware that all PSU faculty members and instructors are required to 
"report information of an incident that may constitute prohibited discrimination, including sexual "
harassment a nd sexual violence. This means that if you tell me about a situation of sexual 
harassment or sexual violence that may have violated university policy or student code of 
"conduct, I have to share the information with my supervisor or the University’s Title I X "
Coordinator or the Office of Affirmative Action. For more information about Title IX please 
complete the required student module Creating a Safe Campus in your CANVAS.   8 
Policy on Academic Honesty  
Academic honesty is a cornerstone of any meaningful educat ion and a reflection of each 
"student's maturity and integrity. The Code of Student Conduct and Responsibility, which applies "
"to all students, prohibits all forms of academic cheating, fraud, and dishonesty. These acts "
"include, but are not limited to: plagi arism, buying and selling of course assignments and research "
"papers, performing academic assignments (including tests and examinations) for other persons, "
"unauthorized disclosure and receipt of academic information, and other practices commonly "
"understood to be academically dishonest. – Portland State University Bulletin, General Catalog "
"Issue, Vol. 56, 2022 -2023.  "
The PSU Student code of conduct can be found at:  
https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -student -code -conduct.   
"Work found to violate this policy may receive an F (0) . To avoid this, the student must respond "
promptly and fully to outreach about explaining and correcting the work. Point deductions may 
still apply to corrected work.  
PSU Code of Conduct on Using AI:  
"“At PSU, the expectation under our Code is that work students submit is their own original work, "
completed without the use of unauthorized materials and tools. This is stated in section 9 of the 
"Code, ‘Unless otherwise specified by the faculty member, all s ubmissions, whether in draft or "
"final form, must either be the Student’s own work, or must clearly acknowledge the source(s). ’ "
"While the code doesn't explicitly prohibit AI technology, it does prohibit cheating, the use of "
"unauthorized materials in the gen eral sense, which would include tools like AI generators, and "
"plagiarism, which is using content without citing appropriate sources. ” "

Course Description  
There is growing evidence that human activity is significantly transforming the natural systems 
that sustain us. Although we may often think of the natural world as something separate from our 
"largely urban lives, our most basic needs such as nutritious fo od to eat, clean air to breath, and "
clean water to drink depend on the health of the natural systems of which we are a part. The focus 
of this course will be on exploring the possibility of maintaining a sustainable relationship 
"between human communities a nd the natural world. To investigate this question , we will explore "
"the interconnectedness of local and global systems (including physical, ecological, cultural, and "
economic).  
This Term  
"In winter term, we looked at some of the major issues like artificial intelligence and climate change "
"that present grand challenges for the 21st century. In this third term of Sustainability, we will focus "
on socio -economic  challenges and on strategies that we can put in place now to help shape a 
resilient and positive future. We will discuss our individual and collective responsibilities to our 
current co -inhabitants and to future generations and how best to induce positive  change via social 
"networking and social pressure, consumer pressure, action in the workplace, economic reform, "
"and active participation in governance at local to national level s. In this term, you will have yet "
more responsibility for shaping the thrust of our discussions and for educating one another 
"through various assignments, class presentations, and debates.  "

Specific objectives for this term are for you to better understand:   
• Economic growth and measures  
"• Social, i ncome and wealth inequality   "
• Equality of opportunity  vs equality of  outcome and intergenerational mobility

CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT  
"A healthy classroom – a place of questioning, sharing and learning – requires our commitment "
both as professor and students to care. I am hopeful that we can make our shared class space a 
thoughtful place to help each other process and deal with all that i s happening now and to think 
"earnestly about how to shape a more positive future. You may hear statements, opinions, or "
arguments that differ significantly from your own ideas or that make no sense from your point of 
view. It is important to remember that students come to Portland State University from diverse 
backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of perspectives. It is not necessary that you like 
other people’s opinions or that they like yours. It is necessary for you to listen to and engage 
others with respect.    
You should do your best to come to class having completed assigned readings and ready to engage 
with the material for the day and with everybody else in the room. Engagement requires attention. 
"Please do not distract yourself or others by eating in the cla ssroom, texting, tweeting or otherwise "
"checking your phone or other electronic devices, or by starting to gather your papers, zip up your "
"backpack, or otherwise begin “checking out"" before the class is excused.    3 "
COURSE POLICIES  
Attendance   
"Learning in this class, and most other university classes, requires your attendance and "
participation. You are required to attend both the main class and the mentor section .  
Absences will adversely affect your grade.   
• Missing five main classes and/or mentor sessions will reduce your final grade by a 
letter grade. If you miss more than eight classes and/or mentor sessions you will 
automatically fail the course.    
• Late arrivals are very disruptive to the classroom environment.  Any of us may encounter 
"unexpected issues on any given day that may delay our getting to class on time. However, if "
"you are regularly more than 10 minutes late to class, you will be marked absent.   "
"• Disruptions in the classroom will not be tolerated. If you act disruptive, you will be asked to "
leave the room and marked absent.   
• If you are forced to miss class for an extended period of time because of exceptional 
"circumstances, make certain to inform me immediately via email  so we may arrange for "
you to make up work.   
Written Work Format   
"Unless instructed otherwise, all assignments should follow these formats:     "
• Turn in work as either a Word (*.doc or *.docx) document (preferred) or PDF file • Include a 
"header with your name, class and date in upper left -hand corner of 1st page  "
• Use double -spaced lines and one -inch margins   
• Use a standard serif typeface (such as Times) at 12 point  
• Use page numbers for multi -page documents  
"• Use complete sentences, correct paragraph structure, correct spelling, and correct grammar!   "
• Please include a complete list of properly formatted references  with appropriate citations .   
• Use the APA style for citations and references . You will find examples of this style at the 
"Purdue Online Writing Lab ,  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/ow l   "
Save everything you write in electronic format in two different places  
Late work   
"Assigned work will typically be collected at the beginning of class on the day that it is due, unless "
otherwise specified on the assignment. Late work turned in by the beginning of the next class 
period following the due date will receive a 20% deduction . Late work will not be  accepted  
"beyond this time, except in cases of compelling, documented emergencies.  It is your "
responsibility to know the due dates and to ensure that your work is turned in on time. Make 
arrangements with one of your peers to obtain no tes and assignments for any days you are absent. 
"If you are going to be absent on an assignment due date, make sure you arrange to get the "
assignment to me BEFORE the start of class.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY    
"Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one's own class and/or course work, being "
"individually accountable, demonstrating intellectual honesty, and abiding by ethical standards. "
Academic integrity is a vital part of the educational experience at PS U. The  Student  Code of Conduc t 
is the university’s policy on academic dishonesty. A violation of that code may result in failure.  
Plagiarism   
The writing you do for this course should be your own. You violate this ethic if you copy materials 
"without acknowledging the source, present specific information without acknowledging the "
"source, present a slightly rearranged wording of source materials a s your own, or submit a copy of "
a paper identical to that submitted by another student. Plagiarism  will result in a zero grade for 
the assignment and possibly lead to more severe  academic consequences. A second offence 
"will  earn you a failing grade for the class. If you are uncertain about anything, ask!   "
Use of Generative AI   
"You are permitted to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to assist you in "
gathering information and brainstorming ideas but you may not copy and paste information 
directly from the AI tool and present it as your own without ap propriate citation and referencing. 
Doing so is plagiarism.  You are responsible for the information you submit based on an AI query 
and for assuring that it does not contain misinformation or unethical content and that it does not 
violate intellectual prop erty laws. You are expected to include a disclosure statement at the end of 
"your assignment describing which AI tool you used and how you used it. For example, ""ChatGPT "
was used to draft about 30 percent of this paper and to provide revision assistance. AI -produced 
content was edited for accuracy and style.”    
UNIVERSITY RESOURCES   
"If you are ever unsure how to find a resource you need or want, here are two “one -stopshopping”  "
"links to  all the PSU resources, portals, and services you need. You can get help with everything "
"from your classes to your finances. Find a tutor, connect with a cultural center, or talk with a "
"counselor. If you don’t see what you need, just as k.   "

"UNST 133D FRESHMAN INQUIRY: THE WORK OF ART Spring 2024: The City as a Work of Art   Instructor:  Dr. Jesse Locker locker@pdx.edu  Mentor: Esther Nor-Ashkarian email: enorash2@pdx.edu   Humans have always created works of art, seeking to record, manipulate, and transform the world around them for the sake of expression, utility, or aesthetic enjoyment. Through the study of these works, we are able to understand the range of human experience. This year-long course uses the theme of “The Work of Art” as a means of exploring a broad range of social, political, philosophical issues. At the same, it provides students with the tools and resources needed to think, write, and speak critically about the work art in the broadest sense and the fundamentals of college-level reading, writing, and critical analysis.  Each term focuses on a different theme, presented through scholarly readings, fiction, film, and artwork that engage works of art the past and present. These sources will serve as a springboard to class discussions, assignments, lectures, and mentor sessions. Spring term focuses on “The City as a Work of Art,” exploring the social, political, and design elements of cities, as well as their representation in art, literature, and film, and the notion of the city both as reality and as metaphor.   COURSE ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES  Our year-long course goals remain: • to gain an introduction to a range of historical and contemporary perspectives on the theme of the work of art  • to acquire exposure to and eventual mastery of University Studies’ four learning goals: (1) inquiry and critical thinking; (2) communication; (3) personal and social ethics; and (4) diversity, equity, and social justice • to develop academic and audience-oriented writing skills; • to gain first-hand familiarity with university learning resources, especially Millar Library and its collections and databases.  COURSE MATERIALS Keri Smith, How to be an Explorer of the World: Portable Art Life Museum (New York, 2008)  Required readings, articles, and prompts are available on the course’s Canvas site    STUDENT EVALUATION Students will be evaluated according to the following criteria. Each week, you will be required to 1) attend and actively participate in class and mentor session, 2) answer 3-4 questions weekly questions about an assigned reading that will be posted to Canvas, 3) complete a final project, based on Keri Smith’s How to be an Explorer of the World, over the course of the term  • Attendance and active participation in class discussion and in-class presentations – 15%.  As this course will be largely based on discussion of ideas and assigned readings, it is imperative that students come prepared daily to contribute actively to class discussions and mentor sections.  This means reading the assigned work in advance and being prepared to offer quality observations, comments, and/or critiques gleaned from the texts. Half of your participation grade will be based on attendance, half on the level and quality of participation. Included in this grade are possible in-class writing assignments and reading checks, an array of brief, and/or random quizzes.  If missed, they may not be made up. • Attendance and active participation in mentor section and associated activities and/or completion of exit tickets – 10%  Weekly Reading Questions (35%)  Most weeks you will be assigned a scholarly essay, article, video, or other prompts on that week’s theme. You will be required to answer questions about them that, unless indicated otherwise, will be due each Wednesday at 11:59 PM. Questions should be submitted via Canvas in MS Word or PDF format, and must be double-spaced, normal margins, and at least a page, but no longer than two. They must be written using complete sentences, in formal language free on misspellings and grammatical errors, and citing any references to the text (a simple parenthetical citation is fine, e.g., “Clausen, p. 262”).  Because these are intended to be preparation for in-class discussion, late reading questions will be deducted 1 point per day late. You are permitted to miss one of these assignments without losing points.    Final project (40%) Your final project, based on Keri Smith’s How to be an Explorer of the World, will be completed in weekly stages throughout the quarter and discussed/completed during mentor session. Details to be announced during the term. PLAGIARISM POLICY Plagiarism, intentional or unintentional, is an intolerable infraction in any setting where ideas are exchanged and discussed.  It is also a violation of the PSU Student Code of Conduct, and egregious or multiple cases may be grounds for suspension or expulsion from the university.  Thanks to recent software advances, detecting plagiarism is extremely easy.  Papers that can be shown to have been plagiarized will automatically receive an “F” grade (or “0”). Remember, ignorance is no excuse!  The PSU Code of Student Conduct considers as plagiarism work submitted for other courses and turned into me as original, and I will ask students to submit new, original work in addition to taking the penalties above. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHER RESOURCES Students with disabilities who need additional consideration for the timely completion of any of the course requirements should speak to the instructor at the beginning of the term, and must be registered with PSU’s Disability Resource Center (drc@pdx.edu).  For information on additional campus resources (SHAC, Career Advising, the Writing Center), contact the instructor.  A Note on Canvas and Grades The “grades” and “attendance” functions on Canvas can give you a general sense of how you’re doing in the class – such as if you’re missing an assignment or what grade you received on a specific project. However, attendance and participation are not calculated until the end of the quarter, and will therefore not be reflected on Canvas. Generally, if you are regularly attending and actively participating in both main and mentor session, it will bring your grade up significantly; lack of attendance  Course schedule and reading assignments (subject to change; check Canvas and email regularly for possible changes/updates)  WEEK 1 (April 2, April 4): What is a city?

COURSE DESCRIPTION  
This year -long course examines the nature and state of healthy individuals and 
populations in their various environments. A dynamic approach will be used to study the 
"places in which people live and interact, such as the community, the workplace, and the "
natural environment. Specific emphasis will be given to social determinants of health and 
"the intersections between health, communities (local and global), and human "
rights.   Topics will focus on ways to examine and address problems that affect health and 
"well-being, ethics, and how social issues have a role to play in health outcomes. "
Professional development in the health context will also be addressed. The Fall Term will 
"examine these topics through Poverty, Income Disparities, the Food Gap, and other "
related issues.  
The Spring Course is divided into 3 Modules:  
• Module 1 – HHHR Neighborhood Food Analysis  (3 Weeks)  
With our Open Educ ation Resources (OERs) we ’ll be looking at HH HR by 
"focusing first on the indi vidual, then the neighborhood/community . We ’ll find "
connections to the social determinants of health and compare an d contra st 
health equity issues.   2 
 • Module 2 – HHHR Community Based Learning Project  (5 weeks)  
"In collaboration  with a nearby medical school and clinic, we ’ll participate in an "
actual health -related research project. Students will have the option of 
"working as research analys ts, report writ ers, active survey ers or interviewers, "
or library /database  researchers. The work you do will be a part of a rese arch 
project underway  in Oregon.  
• Module 3 – HHHR ePortfolio (2 weeks)  
You’ll have an opportunity to spend the last two weeks of the course 
complet ing your ePortfolio project. You should have at least one item 
"reflecting each of the four goals of  UNST: inquiry & critical thinking, "
"communication, diversity, equity and social justice, and ethics, agency,  and "
"community. Prior to turning in your final porfo lio, your instructor will review it "
and provide feedback on any missing pieces.  
COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES:  
"By the end of this three -term course, students will be able to:  "
1. Explain social determinants of health using their own words  
"2. Demonstrate the ability to recognize and evaluate assumptions, the primary "
"alternative points of view and related theories, principles, and ideas relevant "
"to the question, issue, and problem and discern how to apply strengths in "
finding solutions  
3. Explain ethical issues that arise during research  
4. Use systematic inquiry skills to assess neighborhood health  
5. Demonstrate the ability to use information effectively and follow formal and 
informal expectations for written and oral communication to develop and 
explore ideas  
6. Evaluate change in their understanding of health  
7. Apply teamwork skills to support a constructive interdisciplinary climate 
conducive to accomplishing tasks  
8. Improve intercultural communication in issues related to health  
Course Format:  This is an online course divided into three modules. The system will 
"combine discussions, activities, lectures, team projects, papers, and student "
"presentations. We will have an optional synchronous meeting each week, where you can "
do your course discussio n for the week as an option rather than posting to the weekly 
discussion boards. You will also be able to meet once a week with your Peer Mentor. 
Peer Mentors are upper -division PSU students trained to assist with this course. During 
"Mentor sessions, you w ill build on the work introduced by your instructor, participate in "
"team projects, learn and review skills in research, writing, and other areas, and engage in 3 "
 other assignments or projects as assigned by your Mentor.  You will have coursework 
posted by your mentor that will be graded as a part of this class.  
"During the fall term,  we’ll establish the foundation for our understanding of Health, "
"Happiness, and Human Rights in the context of our class. We’ll practice some of the "
techniques to produce solid academic writing. We’ll brush up on our research skills. And 
we’ll put into acti on what we’ve been learning by the end of the course.  
"During the winter term,  we’ll engage in hands -on research and investigation of specific "
instances of health concerns. We will explore various aspects of global injustice through 
"research. To assist our study, we will research an issue you are deeply concerned about "
and relate to our course theme.  
"During the spring  term,  we will engage in a community -based learning project. Thus, we "
will keep developing our understanding of diverse perspectives and empathy. Regarding 
"skills, you will work on communicating your experience,  leading class discussions,  and "
"determining ways to seek positive, proactive change in Health, Happiness, and Human "
Rights. You will be wrapping up the year with your Pebblepad portfolio project  
Freshman/First -Year Inquiry (FRINQ) and its Goals     
FRINQ’s yearlong approach to learning differs from many other educational programs. It 
"is based on collaboration and commitment among the faculty, peer mentors, and "
students in creating and developing a learning community characterized by respect and 
respo nsibility and combining collective and individual participation. The goals of 
University Studies (FRINQ is only your first step) are to develop and strengthen 
metacognitive and other skills beneficial to your academic success and lifelong 
aspirations.  
The four goals are:  
• Inquiry & Critical Thinking : Students will learn various modes of inquiry 
"through interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, "
"conceptualizing —to become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
• Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in 
"various ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —"
to collaborate effectively with others in group work and to be competent in 
appropriate communication technologies.  
"• Diversity, Equity, & Social Justice:  Students will explore and analyze identity, "
"power relationships, and social justice from multiple perspectives in historical "
contexts and contemporary settings.  
"• Ethics, Agency, & Community : Students will examine values, theories, and "
practices that inform their actions and reflect on how personal choices and 
group decisions impact local and global communities.  
More on the University Studies goals: https://www.pdx.edu/university -studies/program -
learning -goals  More about Freshman Inquiry:  https://www.pdx.edu/university -
studies/freshman -inquiry.  4 
"These four general goals constitute the necessary conditions for achievement in college, "
"community activism, and a broad array of professions. FRINQ classes approach the goals "
from an interdisciplinary perspective in preparation for more advanced study. 
"Furthermore, the course encourages students to embrace various cultural practices and "
critical modes of thought.  
  Course Requirements :  
• Work on your Canvas Course at least three times each week. This may include 
"attending your instructor’s synchronous session, participating in the weekly "
"online discussion, interacting with your peer mentor and other students in this "
"class, and submitting y our weekly assignments.  "
"• You are expected to read, watch, or listen to the assigned materials each week "
to complete your assignments successfully. Look at the assignments each 
"week to find the resources you are being asked to read, watch or listen to for "
a given week.   
• All assignments are to be submitted typewritten unless otherwise noted. 
"Make sure to back up your work on your Google Drive or elsewhere, as you "
may want various projects for your ePortfolio at the end of the year. Your 
peer mentor Maria will be your guide  to getting your ePortfolio completed. 
"Check Canvas's modules and class schedule for weekly readings, assignments, "
etc. Students are responsible for tracking due dates.  
"• Grading: As with any course, to pass, students must complete at least 70% of "
the coursework (equivalent to a C -) and attend class by doing work multiple 
times each week through Canvas. Attendance and Participation policies are 
explained in this course desc ription. See PSU’s grading system  here .

scheduled by Sundays.   
"PSU’s standard formula  for planning homework: for each credit hour you are in class, "
estimate that you’ll need to devote 2 hours to work outside of class . (This being a 5 -
"credit hour class, that’s 10 hours a week.) This is an average —some weeks, you may find "
"you don’t have a lot of coursework, and others (especially during midterms and finals), "
you may feel there aren’t enough hours in the day. If you stru ggle with meeting all the 
"demands, reach out to your Peer Mentor and me, as we often help students with this.  "
E-Portfolio  
The E -Portfolio is a requirement for all Freshman Inquiry Courses. The portfolio is a 
collection of digital media files that represent your coursework and achievements. You 
are required to keep a portfolio of your work for this class throughout the entire year. 
Your mentor will guide you through the process of developing an E -Portfolio during your 
peer mentor sessions. You will start this process in the Fall Term and turn in your 
finished E Portfolio at the end of the Spring Term. Your peer mentor will be a n excellent 
resource on this project.  You will be expected to have developed the frame for the E -
Portfolio and have addressed at least one of the UNST goals in it this term. Your peer 
mentor will track your progress on your e -portfolio. Your work -in-progre ss will be 
reviewed by your instructor periodically.  
Community Learning (Extra Credit)  
You have an opportunity to earn up to 10 points in extra credit sometime during the 
term for completing a   community learning activity. This could be participating in a day -
of-service on the PSU campus or some other volunteer opportunity of your choosing. If 
"you are interested in earning extra credit, propose your extra credit project to your "
professor prior to completing it via email or during office hours. Extra credit assignments 
must be pre -approved in order to earn the additional points.   
GENERAL POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS

PSU POLICIES  
Discrimination  
Portland State is committed to providing an environment free of prohibited 
"discrimination and sexual harassment (sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, "
"gender or sex -based harassment, and stalking). If you have experienced sexual "
"harassment, know th at help and support are available. PSU has staff members trained to "
"support survivors in navigating campus life, providing academic support, and more. "
"Information about PSU’s support services on campus, including  confidential "
"services  and reporting options , can be found on PSU’s  Sexual 8 "
" Misconduct  Response  website,  or you may call a Confidential Advocate at "
503.894.7982 or schedule  online . You may also report any incident of discrimination or 
"discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, to the  Title IX "
"Coordinator , Office of Equity and Compliance , or the  Office of the Dean of  Student "
Life. 
Please be aware that all PSU faculty members and instructors  must report  information of 
"an incident that may constitute prohibited discrimination, including sexual harassment "
and sexual and relationship violence. This means that if you tell me about a situation of 
"sexual harassment or discrimination, I have to share the inform ation with the University’s "
"Title IX Coordinator or the Office of the Dean of Student Life.   However, the information "
will be kept private and only those with a need to know will be provided with what you 
disclose.  
You may also report sexual and relationship violence to law enforcement on campus 
with  Campus  Public Safety Office (CPSO).  Or you may file an  anonymous report with 
Campus Public Safety Office  or a Bias Incident report  with the  Bias Review Team 
(BRT).   PSU does not typically investigate the reports that are made through these two 
avenues. These reports help PSU understand what students and employees are 
experiencing on and around campus and provide support where needed.  
As with all other classes at PSU conduct questions not explicitly covered by this syllabus 
are covered by PSU’s Code:  www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -code -student -
conduct -and-responsibility  
Academic Integrity  
All of the work you turn -in must be your own and must be produced for this particular 
course. Turning in work submitted for another course will result in a zero for that 
"assignment. Plagiarism is a serious violation.   Copying someone else’s work, cutting a nd "
"pasting from the Internet, and using quotes or ideas in a paper without providing proper "
citations are all examples of plagiarism. Plagiarism will result in a zero on the assignment 
"and can result in further sanctions, including up to dismissal from Por tland State "
"University. To learn more about what constitutes plagiarism, view this library "

Welcome Statement  You—and everyone else —are welcome here!   
"Portland State University attracts a marvelously varied group of first -year students, "
"people with diverse ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, religious and political beliefs, "
"people whose fami lies are from all over the globe. In a world, nation, state, and city with rigid "
"racial, economic, cultural, and political divides, PSU offers the rare opportunity to know, learn "
"from, and befriend a wide range of people as particular human beings, even as  we form a "
community that is greater than the sum of its parts. I (David) can honestly say that teaching 
FRINQ since 2017 has profoundly changed and deepened my life and brought me much more 
satisfaction than any other work I had done in the sixty years be fore that.  
Course Description  
  The movement of people across borders is a central political and cultural issue 
throughout the world. Although many are aware of the mobility of goods and capital in a global 
"economy, we tend to be less aware of the moveme nt of people in the global economic system "
"and we also tend forget that the movement of people, both as workers and as refugees as well as "
"of people seeking more cosmopolitan experiences, is not a new phenomenon.  "
"As implied by the course title, the question of belonging is central to this class. "
"Immigrants and their children often feel out of place and struggle to find a place, actual or "
"emotional, where they feel as if they belong. Winter term we shall in fact foc us on the tension or "
relationship between individual freedom and choice on the one hand and responsibility and 
"obligation toward others (family, community, nation, and indeed people across the globe) on the "
other hand. And we shall work out that tension in  our own class by listening to and supporting 
"each other. We shall continue to create a place where we can all experience a sense of acceptance and belonging, where we will learn not just about and from each other, but how to sustain each "
other.  
We shall s pend most of spring term continuing to study the experiences of diverse 
immigrants. But this academic study will be informed and supplemented by our exploration of 
"how we can make the world more humane, just, and equitable. The last half of the term will "
focus on an independent research project that can be pursued individually or in groups up to five.  
This five -credit freshman seminar features one Mentored Inquiry session a week as a co -
requisite. These mentor sessions are just as important as the large cla ss meeting. Our expectation 
as instructors is that all of us will come prepared to work hard for the duration of each 
"class.  Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course (five credits each term) that, upon successful "
"completion, conveys 4 credits each in the Hum anities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and "
3 credits in Writing. The course is designed to inculcate particular skills necessary to succeed as 
"a student, citizen, and human being: research, writing, speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, "
"empat hy, and a passion for kindness.  "
University Studies Vision  
"Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously in imagining and co -"
creating a just world.   
University Studies Mission  
"Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry -based pedagog  "
• Provokes students to build self -efficacy through relational learning across difference  
• Encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for transformative 
learning  
"• Advances civic e ngagement, reflective practice, and the scholarship of teaching and "
learning  
University Studies Goals  
• Inquiry and Critical Thinking: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to "
"become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
• Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —
"writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively "
"with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication "
technologies.  
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settin gs from "
multiple perspectives.  
"• Ethics, Agency, and Community:  Students will examine values, theories and practices "
"that inform their actions, and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact "
local and global communities.

Assignments  
Attendance  
Regular participation is perhaps the most essential part of this class and is worth 40 points (and 
40 percent) of your grade. There will be 50 class meetings  (2 50 -minute sessions in large class 
"each Tuesday and Thursday and one peer mentor class on Tuesdays) , and you lose .8 for each "
class (large or peer mentor) that you miss and .4 points for each class you are more than five 
"minutes late for , and that inclu des the second halves of the large class meeting . Unless you are "
"ill, have an emergency, or have made arrangements with the instructor, you are expected and "
"required to attend the class meetings, both for the large class and your peer mentor session. If "
"you miss a class meeting for reasons that your instructor agrees are beyond your control, or to "
"observe a religious holiday, you can make them up by arrangement with the instructor for large "
sessions or the Peer Mentor for peer -mentor sessions. It is up to y ou to contact them promptly  
(within two days of missing the class)  for instructions on how to make up the class. You los e .4 
"point s of attendance for the classes in which we discuss the readings even if you are present, if "
you do not have notes on the read ings done by the time of class.  
Reflections  
Your weekly reflections should be at least 300 words and address both personal and 
"social aspects of your life and week. Of course, more is always welcome. The reflections can be "
"shared with the class on the ref lection’s forum in Canvas Discussion, or, if you want to keep them private, by emailing them (delmard@pdx.edu) to David  or posting them in the Canvas "
Assignments.  
Your personal reflection is about how your week was. Did you encounter any special 
"challenges  or difficulties at school, work, or home life? Is there anything on your mind or that "
you are upset about? What sort of progress do you see yourself making? Are there any 
achievements from this week that you are proud of?  
Your social reflection is more ab out your impact on the broader world. How did you do 
"in class participation? What areas of improvement do you see, and areas where you might "
improve? In what ways did you encourage or listen to someone this week? What did you learn 
from other people this w eek? Do you have any appreciations you would like David to pass along 
"to our guest speakers? If you did any service work, how was that? Of course, include hours "
"worked, and where, but also: 1) What did you do? 2) What did you think and feel while "
"working? How did your previous knowledge and expectations shape your experience, your "
reactions? Why did you feel about what you did? 3) So what? What did you learn about 
yourself? 4) Now what? What is your plan for next time? Will you try to do anything differentl y? 
What?  
Reflections that are less than 300 words or that are posted late without having requested 
an extension will not get full credit. (See Late Policies.)  
Notes on Reading  
"By the start of large class on Thursday, from weeks #2 to # 5, you must turn in  at least a page of "
notes or reflections on the readings for the week. Hand them in at the start of class or post them 
in the Assignments section of our Canvas site. I strongly recommend that your notes focus on 
material that will be helpful to you in writ ing the essays. Each set of satisfactory notes that are 
turned in on time receive s 1.5 points. The notes can be handwritten or typed. If you do not turn 
"in notes by the time of class, you will only receive half credit for attending that class.  "
Short Essay  (and draft)  
"The short essay should not exceed 900 words, though you do not have to count the Works Cited "
"page, references within the text, or page numbers or other headings. There is no minimum word "
"requirement, though of course the more evidence you present to support your thesis, the stronger "
the ess ay will be. Use the MLA (Modern Language Association) guidelines for all your essays or 
any other work that includes references. Here is a set of guidelines with examples . This term I 
"will be taking off 3% for each major error, including: incorrect or missing pagination; incorrect "
"spacing in body, paragraph indentations; incorrect four -line heading; missing references  in the "
text; book titles not italicized; missing or incorrect Works Cited page.  There are sample essays 
"on our D2L site, one from David written many years ago and one from  a previous FRINQ on the "
first essay . You are welcome to write on a question of your  own choosing if you get David’s 
"approval.  The short -essay draft is due the week before the final draft, and 5% will be deducted "
from the final essay grade for each day that the draft is late.

Group Research Project (Presentation and Paper)  
"We shall work out the details of this together, but you will have the last five weeks of the term to "
"work in self -selected groups , or individually,  to research a question you do not already know the "
"answer to that is related to immigration.  The paper should be at least 1,000 words per student, so "
"a group of three, for example, are required to turn in a paper of at least 3,000 words.  "
Learning Portfolio  
"This assignment, which is worth six points, is required by University Studies so that they can "
evaluate the quality of our course. Your portfolio will be presented in a Google Doc with five 
"components, each worth 1.2 points: An “About Me” or autobiographic al home page or "
"introduction that lays out, in at least 300 words, why you selected this FRINQ topic and the most "
"important skills, knowledge, and experiences that you gained from it; four sections on each of "
the four University Studies goals (Inquiry and Critical Thinking; Communication; Diversity; 
"Ethics, Agency, and Community), each including both a FRINQ assignment (such as a reflection "
or essay) from this academic year that illustrates that goal and an explanation of at least 200 
words explaining how t he assignment speaks to the goal.  
 Participatio n/Extra Credit  
The instructor will arrive at your participation grade by considering: your attendance; the 
quality of the presentations and other work created in small groups; peer evaluations of your 
work in small groups; your self -evaluation. Up to three  points of extr a credit can be earned for 
"outstanding participation, including for outstanding work in the peer -mentor sessions . Regular "
"attendance is essential to getting a high participation grade, as is fully participating in all group "
and other class activities.  
You can get up to two extra -credit points by doing service work. There are some options 
"noted in the Syllabus section of Canvas for both in -person or online work, and of course if you "
"are already volunteering at church, mosque, or a community organization, jus t let me know. You "
"get 1 point for every five hours, up to 2 points (10 hours). Service hours should be reported in "
your weekly reflections.  
You get one point for meeting with David one to one and lose one point if you do not 
meet with him.  
Late Policies  
 I usually accept late work without penalty if students notify me before the due date that 
they will need more time because of personal emergencies. I’ll give you one extension per term 
"if you need it just because you are extra busy at that time, but it is a really good idea to get in the "
habit of loo king and planning ahead so all of your work can be turned in on time. If 
circumstances keep you from notifying me before a deadline that you cannot turn an assignment 
"in, let me know as soon as you can. Otherwise, late work will be penalized 10 percent for  each "
day it is late for up to one week. Then it will receive a mark of zero.  
 Requests for the grade of incomplete must be received by the day and time of the last 
"assignment, and such requests will not necessarily be granted.  Students must have complete d at "
least half of the work for the course to receive an incomplete.  If you are unable to keep up with 
"the work of the course during the first half of the term, you should drop the course as soon as "
possible.  
Plagiarism  
It is cheating to pass off the wor k of others as your own.  This includes using the words of others 
without attribution (be sure to use quotation marks and indicating the source of the words) and 
using the words of your fellow students.  Your instructor takes such violations of the ethical  code 
very seriously and will penalize violators as severely as the university allows.  Consequences can 
include failing the class and having the violation noted on your permanent university record. 
Canvas has a Turn -It-In function that enables you to see if you are using other people’s work or 
not. But note that you may have a high score simply because you have quoted other people’s 
"work, so a high score does not necessarily mean that you have committed plagiarism.  "
Accessibility  
It is Portland State Unive rsity's goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. If you 
"anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please register with "
the Disability Resource Center  (DRC) (503 -725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu ) in order to establish 
"reasonable accommodations. Once you have registered with the DRC, please schedule a time to "
talk to me so that we can discuss your needs for the term.  
 Mandatory Reporters  
"PSU strives to address sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, domestic & dating "
"violence, and stalking, in a trauma informed manner. This means that people impacted by sexual "
harassment are provided resources to assist them in addressing sexual harassment in the manne r 
that is best for the person who experienced the harassment. PSU requires all faculty and most 
"staff to report any incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence or "
gender -based stalking that they become aware of. The purpose of reporting the matter is to make 
sure the University provides the impacted person with resources and available complaint 
"processes. If the matter pertains to a student, the report may be made to the  CARE team  through "
"the CARE incident report . Otherwise, you may report the matter to PSU’s Title IX Coordinator "
by emailing her at  titleixcoordinator@pdx.edu . Please make sure you inform the person who has 
disclosed being sexually harassed that you have an obligation to report it to university officials 
"who will keep the information priv ate. If necessary, a Title IX Coordinator or someone from the "
Dean of Student Life will contact you with any follow -up information.

"Portland State University attracts a marvelously varied group of first -year students, "
"people with diverse ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, religious and political beliefs, "
"people whose families are from all over the globe. In a world, nation, state , and city with rigid "
"racial, economic, cultural, and political divides, PSU offers the rare opportunity to know, learn "
"from, and befriend a wide range of people as particular human beings, even as we form a "
community that is greater than the sum of its pa rts. I (David) can honestly say that teaching 
FRINQ since 2017 has profoundly changed and deepened my life and brought me much more 
satisfaction than any other work I had done in the sixty years before that.  
Course Description  
  The movement of people ac ross borders is a central political and cultural issue 
throughout the world. Although many are aware of the mobility of goods and capital in a global 
"economy, we tend to be less aware of the movement of people in the global economic system "
"and we also tend  forget that the movement of people, both as workers and as refugees as well as "
"of people seeking more cosmopolitan experiences, is not a new phenomenon.  "
"As implied by the course title, the question of belonging is central to this class. "
"Immigrants and their children often feel out of place and struggle to find a place, actual or "
"emotional, where they feel as if they belong. Winter term we shall in fact foc us on the tension or "
relationship between individual freedom and choice on the one hand and responsibility and 
"obligation toward others (family, community, nation, and indeed people across the globe) on the "
other hand. And we shall work out that tension in  our own class by listening to and supporting 
each other. We shall continue to create a place where we can all experience a sense of acceptance 2 
"and belonging, where we will learn not just about and from each other, but how to sustain each "
other.  
We shall s pend most of spring term continuing to study the experiences of diverse 
immigrants. But this academic study will be informed and supplemented by our exploration of 
"how we can make the world more humane, just, and equitable. The last half of the term will "
focus on an independent research project that can be pursued individually or in groups up to five.  
This five -credit freshman seminar features one Mentored Inquiry session a week as a co -
requisite. These mentor sessions are just as important as the large class meeting. Our expectation 
as instructors is that all of us will come prepared to work hard for the duration of each 
"class.  Freshman Inquiry is  a year -long course (five credits each term) that, upon successful "
"completion, conveys 4 credits each in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and "
3 credits in Writing. The course is designed to inculcate particular skills necessary to succ eed as 
"a student, citizen, and human being: research, writing, speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, "
"empathy, and a passion for kindness.  "
University Studies Vision  
"Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously in imagini ng and co -"
creating a just world.   
University Studies Mission  
"Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry -based pedagog  "
• Provokes students to build self -efficacy through relational learning across difference  
• Encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for transformative 
learning

learning  
University Studies Goals  
• Inquiry and Critical Thinking: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to "
"become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
• Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in vario us ways —
"writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively "
"with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication "
technologies.  
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and analyz e identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from "
multiple perspectives.  
"• Ethics, Agency, and Community:  Students will examine values, theories and practices "

Assignments  
Attendance  
Regular participation is perhaps the most essential part of this class and is worth 40 points (and 
40 percent) of your grade. There will be 50 class meetings  (2 50 -minute sessions in large class 
"each Tuesday and Thursday and one peer mentor class on Tuesdays) , and you lose .8 for each "
class (large or peer mentor) that you miss and .4 points for each class you are more than five 
"minutes late for , and that inclu des the second halves of the large class meeting . Unless you are "
"ill, have an emergency, or have made arrangements with the instructor, you are expected and "
"required to attend the class meetings, both for the large class and your peer mentor session. If "
"you miss a class meeting for reasons that your instructor agrees are beyond your control, or to "
"observe a religious holiday, you can make them up by arrangement with the instructor for large "
sessions or the Peer Mentor for peer -mentor sessions. It is up to y ou to contact them promptly  
(within two days of missing the class)  for instructions on how to make up the class. You los e .4 
"point s of attendance for the classes in which we discuss the readings even if you are present, if "
you do not have notes on the read ings done by the time of class.  
Reflections  
Your weekly reflections should be at least 300 words and address both personal and 
"social aspects of your life and week. Of course, more is always welcome. The reflections can be "
"shared with the class on the ref lection’s forum in Canvas Discussion, or, if you want to keep 6 "
"them private, by emailing them (delmard@pdx.edu) to David  or posting them in the Canvas "
Assignments.  
Your personal reflection is about how your week was. Did you encounter any special 
"challenges  or difficulties at school, work, or home life? Is there anything on your mind or that "
you are upset about? What sort of progress do you see yourself making? Are there any 
achievements from this week that you are proud of?  
Your social reflection is more ab out your impact on the broader world. How did you do 
"in class participation? What areas of improvement do you see, and areas where you might "
improve? In what ways did you encourage or listen to someone this week? What did you learn 
from other people this w eek? Do you have any appreciations you would like David to pass along 
"to our guest speakers? If you did any service work, how was that? Of course, include hours "
"worked, and where, but also: 1) What did you do? 2) What did you think and feel while "
"working? How did your previous knowledge and expectations shape your experience, your "
reactions? Why did you feel about what you did? 3) So what? What did you learn about 
yourself? 4) Now what? What is your plan for next time? Will you try to do anything differentl y? 
What?  
Reflections that are less than 300 words or that are posted late without having requested 
an extension will not get full credit. (See Late Policies.)  
Notes on Reading  
"By the start of large class on Thursday, from weeks #2 to # 5, you must turn in  at least a page of "
notes or reflections on the readings for the week. Hand them in at the start of class or post them 
in the Assignments section of our Canvas site. I strongly recommend that your notes focus on 
material that will be helpful to you in writ ing the essays. Each set of satisfactory notes that are 
turned in on time receive s 1.5 points. The notes can be handwritten or typed. If you do not turn 
"in notes by the time of class, you will only receive half credit for attending that class.  "
Short Essay  (and draft)  
"The short essay should not exceed 900 words, though you do not have to count the Works Cited "
"page, references within the text, or page numbers or other headings. There is no minimum word "
"requirement, though of course the more evidence you present to support your thesis, the stronger "
the ess ay will be. Use the MLA (Modern Language Association) guidelines for all your essays or 
any other work that includes references. Here is a set of guidelines with examples . This term I 
"will be taking off 3% for each major error, including: incorrect or missing pagination; incorrect "
"spacing in body, paragraph indentations; incorrect four -line heading; missing references  in the "
text; book titles not italicized; missing or incorrect Works Cited page.  There are sample essays 
"on our D2L site, one from David written many years ago and one from  a previous FRINQ on the "
first essay . You are welcome to write on a question of your  own choosing if you get David’s 
"approval.  The short -essay draft is due the week before the final draft, and 5% will be deducted "
from the final essay grade for each day that the draft is late.

"We shall work out the details of this together, but you will have the last five weeks of the term to "
"work in self -selected groups , or individually,  to research a question you do not already know the "
"answer to that is related to immigration.  The paper should be at least 1,000 words per student, so "
"a group of three, for example, are required to turn in a paper of at least 3,000 words.  "
Learning Portfolio  
"This assignment, which is worth six points, is required by University Studies so that they can "
evaluate the quality of our course. Your portfolio will be presented in a Google Doc with five 
"components, each worth 1.2 points: An “About Me” or autobiographic al home page or "
"introduction that lays out, in at least 300 words, why you selected this FRINQ topic and the most "
"important skills, knowledge, and experiences that you gained from it; four sections on each of "
the four University Studies goals (Inquiry and Critical Thinking; Communication; Diversity; 
"Ethics, Agency, and Community), each including both a FRINQ assignment (such as a reflection "
or essay) from this academic year that illustrates that goal and an explanation of at least 200 
words explaining how t he assignment speaks to the goal.  
 8 
Participatio n/Extra Credit  
The instructor will arrive at your participation grade by considering: your attendance; the 
quality of the presentations and other work created in small groups; peer evaluations of your 
work in small groups; your self -evaluation. Up to three  points of extr a credit can be earned for 
"outstanding participation, including for outstanding work in the peer -mentor sessions . Regular "
"attendance is essential to getting a high participation grade, as is fully participating in all group "
and other class activities.  
You can get up to two extra -credit points by doing service work. There are some options 
"noted in the Syllabus section of Canvas for both in -person or online work, and of course if you "
"are already volunteering at church, mosque, or a community organization, jus t let me know. You "
"get 1 point for every five hours, up to 2 points (10 hours). Service hours should be reported in "
your weekly reflections.  
You get one point for meeting with David one to one and lose one point if you do not 
meet with him.  
Late Policies  
 I usually accept late work without penalty if students notify me before the due date that 
they will need more time because of personal emergencies. I’ll give you one extension per term 
"if you need it just because you are extra busy at that time, but it is a really good idea to get in the "
habit of loo king and planning ahead so all of your work can be turned in on time. If 
circumstances keep you from notifying me before a deadline that you cannot turn an assignment 
"in, let me know as soon as you can. Otherwise, late work will be penalized 10 percent for  each "
day it is late for up to one week. Then it will receive a mark of zero.  
 Requests for the grade of incomplete must be received by the day and time of the last 
"assignment, and such requests will not necessarily be granted.  Students must have complete d at "
least half of the work for the course to receive an incomplete.  If you are unable to keep up with 
"the work of the course during the first half of the term, you should drop the course as soon as "
possible.  
Plagiarism  
It is cheating to pass off the wor k of others as your own.  This includes using the words of others 
without attribution (be sure to use quotation marks and indicating the source of the words) and 
using the words of your fellow students.  Your instructor takes such violations of the ethical  code 
very seriously and will penalize violators as severely as the university allows.  Consequences can 
include failing the class and having the violation noted on your permanent university record. 
Canvas has a Turn -It-In function that enables you to see if you are using other people’s work or 
not. But note that you may have a high score simply because you have quoted other people’s 
"work, so a high score does not necessarily mean that you have committed plagiarism.  "
Accessibility  
It is Portland State Unive rsity's goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. If you 
"anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please register with "
the Disability Resource Center  (DRC) (503 -725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu ) in order to establish 
"reasonable accommodations. Once you have registered with the DRC, please schedule a time to "
talk to me so that we can discuss your needs for the term.

Mandatory Reporters  
"PSU strives to address sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, domestic & dating "
"violence, and stalking, in a trauma informed manner. This means that people impacted by sexual "
harassment are provided resources to assist them in addressing sexual harassment in the manne r 
that is best for the person who experienced the harassment. PSU requires all faculty and most 
"staff to report any incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence or "
gender -based stalking that they become aware of. The purpose of reporting the matter is to make 
sure the University provides the impacted person with resources and available complaint 
"processes. If the matter pertains to a student, the report may be made to the  CARE team  through "
"the CARE incident report . Otherwise, you may report the matter to PSU’s Title IX Coordinator "
by emailing her at  titleixcoordinator@pdx.edu . Please make sure you inform the person who 
has disclosed being sexually harassed that you have an obligation to report it to university 
"officials who will keep the information priv ate. If necessary, a Title IX Coordinator or someone "
from the Dean of Student Life will contact you with any follow -up information.

"SYLLABUS  - Immigration FRINQ, Condensed , Hybrid, Spring 2024  -Fernández  "
The mantra for our course & discussions  
"People in a state of Relaxed Alertness experience low threat and high challenge (Caine 
& Caine, 1991/1994, 2010). Essentially, the learner is both relaxed and to some extent 
excited or emotionally engaged at the same time. This is the foundation for takin g risks in 
thinking, questioning, and experimenting, all of which are essential to mastering new 
skills and engaging higher -order thinking.  In this state, the learner feels competent and 
confident and has a sense of meaning or purpose. (f. Chapter 2 – Why  Relaxed Alertness "
"Provides the Optimum Emotional Climate for Learning, in the book  12 Brain / Mind "

What’s a condensed course?  
Freshmen Inquiry courses (“FRINQs”) at Portland State University span three  
"terms  (fall, winter, and spring). This course, however, is condensed. We are only "
together for two terms —generally only for winter and spring terms. In our “condensed 
course” we w ill be doing all the major assignments in  two terms  instead of  three terms.  
● Sharing a heads up: “Condensed courses”  at the University are “intense 
courses.”  
"If you are looking for a FRINQ that spans three terms, go here to register. Please "
"note that yearlong FRINQ courses start each fall. Depending on your situation, you may "
have to wait until next academic year to enroll in a yearlong FRINQ.  
Need help with registering which course is right for you?  Schedule an 
appointment with an academic adviser  today!  
General course description

"SYLLABUS  - Immigration FRINQ, Condensed , Hybrid, Spring 2024  -Fernández  "
"Specific Course Description: Immigration, Migration, and Belonging  "
The movement of people across borders is a central  political and cultural issue 
"throughout the world. In North and South, East and West, the issue of immigration, "
"migration, and belonging (IMB) is a controversial one. Although most of us are aware of "
"the mobility of goods and capital in a global economy, we tend to be less aware that the "
"mobility of labor too is an integral part of the global economic system, or that most "
"migration takes place not between North and South, but within the South. We also tend to "
"forget that the movement of people, both as wor kers and as refugees, is not a new "
"phenomenon. We also lose sight of the fact that most of the world's populations, "
"including in the poorest countries, do not migrate across international borders.  Current "
"events in Europe, of course, may be telling us oth erwise.  "
Population mobility across international borders and the resultant transnational 
communities thus raise questions about the official “histories” of immigration for each 
"nation state, the meanings of borders, the nature of belonging, identity, and c ulture and "
"their relationship to politics, and the realities of multiculturalism even in places that think "
"of themselves as monocultural.1 These important historical, cultural, and ontological "
"questions about immigration, migration, and belonging (IMB) wil l frame our yearlong "
discussions and will inform formal academic research assignments and community based 
"learning projects and actions. During fall term, students will learn about immigration, "
"migration, and belonging (IMB) by examining their own specific  IBM story. Throughout "
"the year, readings, case studies, interviews, and workshops will introduce common "
"language, methodologies, and best practices.  "
Dr. Fernández’s  learning goals and outcomes1 
This class aims to improve students’ ability to:  
● Identify  and analyze  relationships among diverse immigrant groups in the United States.  
● Identify  and analyze  relationships that students experienced based on their immigration story.  
"● Use multiple sources of information to analyze specific immigrant groups in popul ar culture (books, "
"movies, social media, news sources, for example).  "
● Practice  mindfulness as one element that supports individual emotional well -being.  
● Identify  strategies that immigrant communities can use their wellbeing.  
"● Appraise  how world literature, news sources, and other modern cultural artifacts (for example, TV "
"shows, specific social media) represent immigrants.  "
"● Report  on how world literature, news sources, and other modern cultural artifacts (for example, TV "
"shows, specific social media) represen t immigrants.  "
Please note:  
"● This course features 5 -6 modules, depending on the term.  "

2 unexcused  tardiness =  1 absence  
2 late unexcused arrivals (“tardiness”) to lecture    = 1 absence (cumulative)  
2 late unexcused arrivals (“tardiness”) to  mentor sectional  = 1 absence (cumulative)  
Unexcused absences = deduction of grade points in mentor’s attendance participation 
grade  
"● 1 unexcused absence in lecture = 2 points off  lecture grade  (1:2 ratio, "
cumulative)  
● 1 unexcused absence in mentor sectionals = 2 points off mentor participation 
"grade (1:2 ratio, cumulative)  "
"8. May I use my cell phone or laptop  for personal uses (i.e., not related to in person "
classroom activities) in the lecture and mentioral sectionals?  
● No.  
"● During in-person lectures and ment or sectionals, the use of "
cell phones (including laptops) to check non -course -related 
materials  is prohibited.   
● Cell phone use not related to course work or mentor sectional 
work results in:  
● 1 verbal warning by professor or mentor  
● Second warning = absence for the given day

General Course Description  
This course introduces the Examining Popular Culture cluster. In this course students will 
"become more active, informed, and self -aware observers of the media that saturate our world. "
"Students will analyze how popular culture artifacts reflect and influence the social, cultural, "
"historical, and commercial contexts of our everyday lives. Students will examine how the "
"concept of ""popular culture"" has evolved, and might continue to evolve, with the emergence of "
"new media forms, in local, national, and global contexts. Employing a variet y of scholarly "
"approaches, students will engage critically and creatively with media -driven consumer culture "
and the ways in which it speaks to different social identities. As students study the ever -
"expanding role that popular culture plays in global comm unities, they will develop as engaged "
"readers of text, proficient researchers in the many scholarly approaches to popular culture, and "
persuasive writers and speakers. By treating popular culture as a subject of rigorous scholarly 
"inquiry, students will be  in a better position to treat the texts of popular culture skeptically, "
"critically, and with an awareness of their contextual implications.  (Source ) "
Specific Course Descrip tion 
     This course is designed to introduce the student to the critical study of popular culture through 
"the focus of fairy tales. We are surrounded by fairy tales and their echoes, artifacts, and "
"adaptations in our daily lives, whether we recognize it or not. From window displays to music, "
"TV shows, movies and more, fairy tales are ever -present in our lives. Because we are so "
"immersed in elements of fairy tales in our daily lives, it can make these difficult to identify and "
critically analyze.  
"     As lifelong learners and critical thinkers, we need to be able to identify and assess the images "
and ideas that we encounter in our daily lives so that we can attempt to understand how they are 
"being used to influence us, and the stakes involved. Fairy tales h ave been with all of us since "
"birth, and they have influenced our beliefs and values. We need to recognize how they are being "
"deployed in order to understand how their use in popular culture affects our ideas, beliefs, and "
"values as individuals and as a so ciety. Once we recognize the power of fairy tales and popular culture on ourselves and society, we can work within our culture to craft the world we want to "
see. 
Online and Student -Centered  
"     By default online classes are student -centered, since there  is no teacher at the front of the "
classroom giving lectures. You are far more responsible for your own education in an 
"asynchronous online class than you are in an in -person class, or even an online class with "
"meeting times. There is no set time that you need to be anywhere or doing anything for this class, "
unless you give yourself a schedule (which I highly recommend).  
"            This is NOT a correspondence course. While there are no meeting times, it still runs on a "
weekly schedule and requires weekly participation. You cannot rush through everything in the 
first few weeks and then be finished. You have to go at the normal class speed and participate in 
the weekly class requirements.  
    You will be asked to engage with your fellow students in multiple discussion boards on a 
"weekly basis. You will be assigned readings by the instructor, but you will also be researching on "
your own and bringing your findings back to your classmates where everyone can engage in a 
"discussion. In this way, you will be teachi ng each other.  "
"There are also individual assignments, including short weekly journals and a longer research "
essay.  
University Studies learning goals  
Our assignments will help illustrate the learning goals below:  
• Inquiry and Critical Thinking (INQ): Stude nts will learn various modes of inquiry

"**As this is an online class, you need reliable internet access for this course**  "
"For each credit hour of an asynchronous online course, expect to spend  a minimum of 3 hours "
working on the class each week. Thus a 4 -credit course can be expected to require 12 hours of 
work each week.  
Late Work:  
"If you miss assignments, there are options for you to still earn some of the grade from those "
assignments:  
"-For discussion boards: these stand in for classroom discussion, and thus cannot be made up.  "
"-For Journals: If you complete a journal late it will be graded as normal, then lose 1 point for "
"every week that it is late (1 -7 days = -1, 8-14 days = -2, etc.)  "
"-For the Fairy Tale Artifact Presentation: Since this is due in Week 10, which is t he last week of "
"class, there is really no time for it to be late. If you are unable to turn it in on time, you may "
email the professor regarding turning it in during Finals Week . 
"-For the Final Paper: This is due Finals Week, so there is really no time for it to be late. If you "
"are unable to turn it in on time, email the professor regarding turning it in before the end of "
Finals Week.  
I do not accept late work without penalty unl ess you contacted me prior to the due date AND I 
granted you an extension or if you have a preexisting allowance through Disability Services.  
If an emergency arises that will impact your ability to devote time to this class – even if there is 
no impending assignment due – contact me as soon as possible so that we can make a plan for 
you to succeed in this class and retain your sanity at the same time. If an emergency prevents you 
"from turning in an assignment, contact me as soon as you can. These situations  will be dealt with "
on a case by case basis.  
There are several different types of assignments for this class:   Weekly:  
"• There will be multiple readings every week, usually consisting of one scholarly article "
and one or two older versions of the week's fai ry tale. There may be a modern version of 
the fairy tale to read. When you first see the list of links for readings it may seem 
"daunting, but fairy tales are usually short and quick to read. There's not as much reading "
as it might appear.  
"• There may videos to watch, audio to listen to, or other artifacts to interact with relating to "
modern versions of the week's fairy tale.  
• There may be a short lecture to watch or listen to regarding the week's focus.  
"• Class discussion boards (COMM, INQ, DIV, ETH):  "
o Every stud ent needs to participate in the discussion boards every week by both 
"posting and responding to someone else's post. Remember, these are  discussion  "
"boards, so use ""open"" questions or comments which both comment on the content "
from the week and provide a pat h for someone else to join the conversation. 
"(""yes"" or ""I didn't enjoy it"" are closed comments and will not earn you points. "
There is nowhere for another person to go with those statements.) You need to 
write a minimum of 1 substantive original post and 2 substantive comments.  
"• Journal (COMM, INQ, DIV, ETH):  "
o You will write a journal with a minimum of 300 words synthesizing all the 
"materials and your takeaways from the week. Tell me what you learned, what you "
"liked (or didn't like), agreed or disagreed with from the readings. This is where "
you engage on an individual level with the materials from the week. This is not a 
summary or reading report. This is a place where you think about and engage with 
"the materials for the week. For every 25 words a journal is short, it will lose a "
"point. (299 -275 = -1, 274 -250 = -2, etc.)   "
End of Term:  
"• 1,500 -2,000 word Final Paper   "
• Artifact Presentation  
There will be assignment sheets explaining each of these larger assignments.

University Studies (UNST) Goals  
"Sophomore Inquiry is a quarter -long course based on a philosophy that faculty, peer mentors and "
students should collaborate to c reate a learning community in which we all learn from one other. 
It is meant to introduce you to concepts you may explore more deeply later in your junior cluster 
"courses. All UNST courses have at their foundation four goals important to educational, profe ssional, and civic success:  "
Communication  
"Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways—writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group "
"work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
Inquiry and Critical Thinking  
Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula —problem -
"posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become active, self -motivated, and "
empowered l earners.   
"Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice  "
"Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives. "
"Ethics, Agency, and Community "
"Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on how "
personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities. 
Mentored Course Work  
UNST offers the unique opportunity for undergraduates to work with a graduat e student peer 
"mentor in addition to the instructor. Mentors facilitate discussions and projects and act as a support person and ""expert student"" familiar with campus resources and student best practices. In this class, your peer mentor will facilitate the  mentor facilitated workshops in Discussions and "
offer one -on-one support and feedback as needed. Your peer mentor for this course is Qin He. 
Course Overview  
What is Popular Culture?  
For the purpose of this class we will define it broadly (with a little he lp from 
"Wikipedia): Popular culture  is the entirety of ideas, perspectives, attitudes, memes,  images, "
"artifacts, and other phenomena that are preferred by an informal consensus within the mainstream of a given culture, especially Western culture of the ea rly to mid 20th century and "
"the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st century. Heavily influenced by mass media (and corporations), this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society.  "
Who studies it?  
"Popular Culture S tudies is an interdisciplinary field. Those who research, develop and apply "
"theories to it, and write about it are from a variety of disciplines (many in the Humanities) including Journalism, Literary Studies, Music, Education, History, Film Studies, Women’s Studies, Ethnic Studies, Art, Communications and Media Studies.  "
Why are we going to study it?  
"Popular culture media and phenomena influence us on personal, social, and cultural levels. This course aims to develop the critical thinking skills necessary t o engage with media as active and "
"informed scholars, consumers, and citizens by providing practical, step- by-step tools for finding "
and analyzing information. 
Learning Objectives  
"This course was designed with the following question in mind: What do people in the 21st century need to know or be able to do? -- as informed and engaged professionals, community "
"members, leaders, problem solvers, parents, etc? The learning objectives of this course are based on answering that question. By the end of this class st udents will be able to:  "
"• Be excellent ""fact -checkers""  "
• Locate credible sources of information online  • Evaluate arguments 
• Understand context and purpose of information 
• Analyze messages and narratives in media and recognize how they influence our 
understanding and actions as individuals and as a society  
• Feel empowered and confident in participating in political and/or intellectual discourse  
"• Share their knowledge, information, and self -created media ethically  "
• Tell their own stories; listen to stories of others  
"• Reflect on their own learning. Develop connections between experience, values, and "
knowledge  
Course Assignments

👁👁 Go to Modules using the course tool bar (to the left) to 
see each week's theme with detailed instructions and due 
dates!  
👀👀 Use the Weekly Overview and Checklists to make sure 
you've completed assignments due for that week!  
Course Discussions  
"• Weekly Dis cussions: Each week on Monday afternoon I will post a ""lecture"" with "
prompts related to that week's reading in Discussions. By the end of the week you 
will respond by replying to the prompts as well as on one another's comments.  
"• Mentor Facilitated Workshops: You'll participate in four, two -week small group "
activity/discussion in preparation for formal assignments/graded work.  Weekly Discussion Comment Rubric  
"Three times during the term, I will assess grades for your comments and replies to the lectures in "
Discussions.  
The following are criteria for your original postings to the weekly class discussion forums and your replies to others postings (Total of 300 points). Your class discussions will be assessed based on both quantity and quality.  
• Number of posts  
• Quality and depth of responses to instructor prompts  
• Quality of responses to other students  
"• Connections to texts, experience, and research  "
• Organization and proofreading  
Workshop Group Rubric  
"You, your mentor, and your workshop group members will assess your participation in the small group workshops using the following criteria:  "
•       Posted comments regularly and on time  
"•       Offered challenges, support, and suggestions "
•       Comments were substantive and meaningful  
"•       Responses were non -defensive, honest, and respectful  "
•       Comments reflected an interest in the success of individual and the group goals  
Keys to Discussion success  
• Please participate in online discussions as you would in constructive face -to-face 
discussions.  
• Please be professional a nd courteous. 
• Online communication lacks the non -verbal cues that provide much of the meaning in 
"face- to-face conversations. Choose your words carefully, phrase your sentences "
clearly. Be careful with sarcasm.  
"• Use ""reply"" when responding to another person' s comment.   "
• Reply to others' comments by using that person's name. Make clear when you are responding to an individual or posting a general comment or question to the whole class.  
"• Feel free to record a video or audio of your reply. If you do, please keep your response short --  two minutes or less.  "
"• Proofread what you post. You may want to use a word doc to draft what you intend to say, check your spelling and grammar, and then paste your text into the reply box of the discussion. "
• Check in with our discussions more than once per week.   Respond to those who have 
taken the time to write a response to your comments.   This will help create an 
"ongoing conversation.  • When you write your comments, address the class as a whole or the specific person "
you are responding to.   
"• Be respectful of one another, but don't be afraid to disagree!   Constructive conflict "
"helps us all learn. Besides, things get really boring when we all come to the same conclusions.  "

Plagiarism  
"Plagiarism is taking another person's work and using it as your own, including using AI programs such as ChatGPT. When writers use material from other sources, they must acknowledge this source. Not doing so is called plagiarism, which means using without credit the ideas or expressions of another. You are therefore cautioned against using  "
"1. Phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., word -for-word, without acknowledgment, from "
the written material of others;  
"2. Phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., with only slight c hanges the written materials of "
another; and  
"3. The general plan, the main headings, or a rewritten form of someone else's material.  "
4. AI generated writing.  
These cautions apply to the work of other students as well as to the published work of professional or a mateur writers.  
"If you submit someone else's writing or ideas as your own, you will fail the assignment and may be reported to the Dean of Students. It is against the PSU Code of Conduct to submit the same assignment for multiple courses college's student conduct office for further action. Learning how "
"to separate your ideas and words from those of others, ensuring proper credit to everyone involved, is a goal of this class. When in doubt, ask me!  "

to student conduct at PSU. 
Click he re for a list of Frequently Asked Questions  
Support and Resources  
I care about my students and I want them to succeed!  
"I also know that college can be a stressful time in people's lives. Actually, being an adult is just plain stressful. When something disruptive happens, we have to go into survival mode, and let even important things go. If you face a disruption this term, please speak up, and please don't disappear! Email me and/or your graduate peer mentor! We can offer support, resources, and accommo dations. We want you to succeed, and we can help, but only if we know you need it. "
Your instructor and graduate peer mentor work as a team to identify and reach out to students and to offer extra help.  
Succeeding in college does not mean that you don’t str uggle in a class or classes or during 
"particular quarters. My goal as your instructor, and our goal at Portland State, is to do what we can to support all students and facilitate their success. Early Alerts and Care Team referrals are "
ways we try to suppor t our students. It’s a process by which your instructor can link you to 
"academic advisors or campus support, and it’s a time for your instructors to let you know what changes you can make toward success in the course and engage in a learning partnership wi th "
"you. This is a way to open up the conversation between you, your advisor, and your instructor so that together you can work out how to achieve your educational goals.  "
Getting an Early Alert is not an indication that you will not succeed in the course. It is a call to action. You might get an email or phone call from an advisor. Please engage in this process. Students who have taken advantage of resources offered to them are able to move forward and succeed in the course.  
"Any student who has difficulty a ffording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, "
"or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the graduate peer mentor for support and resources. Furthermor e, "
"please notify me or graduate peer mentor if you are comfortable in doing so. PSU is a big place -- I was a student here once myself, and I felt lost when I first came here, but there are resources "
available and people to help you find them. Below are just a few.

WHAT IS THIS CLASS ABOUT?  
"Popular Culture: Analysis, Theory, Practice  "
Popular culture both reflects and shapes the societies in which it is produced and consumed. Its 
"characterization as either frivolous or mundane, however, conceals pop culture ’s tremendous power to influence social values and practices and vice -versa. Studying popular culture makes it "
"possible to better unders tand how the culture industries (including film, television, music, print "
"and online publishing, advertising, sports, fashion, games, consumer products, and more) and "
"folk cultures (fandoms, traditions) shape societies. The ability to analyze popular cultu re in its "
social context will enable you to take charge of the degree to which pop culture influences your 
values and decisions while also helping you develop effective strategies for deploying culture in 
the fight for social change. You will also have the  opportunity to develop skills in using digital 
video to present your ideas powerfully in one of today's most influential pop culture forms.  
"Collaborative, Inquiry -based Learning  "
"Sophomore Inquiry is a quarter -long course based on the principle that facul ty, peer mentors, "
and students should collaborate to form an interdisciplinary classroom environment in which 
we all learn from one another. You will be expected to conduct primary and secondary source 
research and to bring what you learn back to class dis cussion as well as your research project. In 
"keeping with this philosophy, you will be expected to share and receive ideas, feedback, and "
critique with your classmates throughout the course. Your success depends on your peers' 
"careful, thoughtful, critical  comments. Their success depends on yours. Your instructor and "
mentor depend as much on your input as you do on theirs.  
Writing Intensive  
"Expect to write a lot. After all, this course, along with your other SINQ, fulfills your PSU writing "
requirement. The  writing assignments in this course enable you to explore the specific pop 
"culture texts and social issues you find most interesting and relevant to your life. In our class, "
"you’ll use writing as a tool to process ideas as well as to communicate your ideas  with peers, "
"your course mentor, your instructor, and other audiences. The assignments encourage "
"collaborative learning, independent inquiry, and a reflective learning practice that facilitates a "
deeper processing of course concepts and encourages connecti on to real -world issues.  
Challenging Oppression and Hierarchy  
"We will approach the class by recognizing that all participants, not only the instructor, have "
valuable knowledge to contribute as co -learners. Each of us will bring different perspectives and 
insights to the course and respecting those differences will be crucial to having rewarding 
learning experiences together.   
Many of these differences are not merely the result of personal choices. They reflect the ways 
"we are caught up in complex structure s of social hierarchy, which affects the process of learning. "
"Because of this, we will directly confront and engage the power dynamics present in our class as "
well as those conveyed through the pop culture we study. Doing so will provoke challenging 
"conver sations full of conflict, however, we will have the best learning experiences when "
participants take the risk to be honest and forthright with one another when they disagree. As 
"such, this course should be thought of as a “brave space. ” Click on the follow ing link to read "
more on the concept of brave spaces vs. safe spaces:

COURSE TEXTS  
Almost all of your readings will be available on Canvas for you to read. There is  no textbook to 
purchase. There is only one text that you need to access outside of Canvas: WALL -E (Andrew 
"Stanton, dir, 2008). It can be accessed through the Multnomah and Washington County Libraries "
"for free. It is also available through Disney+. If none  of these options work for you, it can be "
"rented online for $3.99 through YouTube, Google Play, Vudu, iTunes, and Amazon Prime.  "
"All other readings, videos, and audio files required for this class will be available through "
"Canvas, the Internet, or, in the case of your research for your term project, the University "
Library.  
ASSIGNMENTS & EXPECTED WORKLOAD

Zoom meeting with Dr. Sommariva before January 31  
Workload  
The expectation at PSU (and most other universities) is that students will spend around two to 
three hours per credit outside of class each week doing things related to the course. That means 
you need  to set aside 8 -12 hours per week to work on things for this class. I am aware that 
"some students think that general education courses should be less work than others, but that is "
"simply not true. This is a four -credit course, and it is as much work as any  other four -credit "
"course. I recognize that many of you have a lot of other responsibilities in your life, and I urge "
you to be realistic about how much you take on.  
Taking a full -time course load is as time -consuming as holding down a full -time job. I d o not 
assign anything that is “busy work. ” All the assignments and quizzes have been developed 
"through years of teaching experience, student feedback, peer feedback, and thoughtful "
"reflection. If you are ever uncertain about the purpose of an assignment, p lease ask me about "
it. I want you to leave this course with a lot of new insight about how pop culture both shapes 
"and reflects the world in which we live and with skills in conducting research, analyzing culture, "
"and harnessing pop culture forms to commun icate your ideas effectively through video, images, "
"speech, and text. But more importantly, this course, like all USNT courses, is designed for you to "
develop crucial transferable job skills that other courses usually don't or can't spend time on -- 
see Le arning Objectives below  
LEARNING OBJECTIVES  
University Studies Learning Goals  
Critical Inquiry (INQ): Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary 
"curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —to become active, self -motivated, "
and empowered learners.  
Communication (COMM): Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various 
"ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively "
"with others in group work, and to be compet ent in appropriate communication technologies.  Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice (DIV): Students will explore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple "
perspectives.  
"Ethics, Agency, and Community (EAC): Students will examine values, theories, and practices that "
"inform their actions, and they will reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact "
local and global communities.  
Course -Specific Goals  
Learn strategies for interpreting popular culture that account for the influence of aesthetic 
"tropes, social contexts, and economic structures. (INQ, DIV, EAC)  "
"Construct effective arguments about the relationship between popular culture, social norms, "
"economics,  and subjectivities at local, national, and global levels. (COMM, DIV, EAC)  "
Learn research methods and develop research questions that draw from a variety of scholarly 
"fields (INQ, DIV, EAC)  "
Learn how individuals have used the tools of popular culture to i nterpret and change their 
"societies (INQ, DIV, EAC)  "
"Develop skills in collaboration through class discussion and peer review, which will increase "
"one’s understanding of diverse perspectives (COMM, DIV)  "
You Can Adapt how We Achieve the Above Objectives  
"I intend that students from all backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that "
students ’ learning needs be addressed through the Canvas course as well as through personal 
"interaction with myself and the course mentor, and that the diversity  that students bring to this "
"class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I endeavor to present materials and "
"activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, "
"ethnicity, race, nationality, citi zenship status, culture, and size. Of course, there is always room "
"for improvement, so your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. I believe in being flexible, so please do reach out to let me know how I can make this course respond to your "
needs as a  learner and as a unique human being.  
ACCESS & INCLUSION FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES  
PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full 
"participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environme nt that is equitable, "
"useable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in "
"barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Disability Resource Center (DRC) "
provides reasonable accommodations for students  who encounter barriers in the learning 
environment.  
"Disabilities include a wide range of conditions, physical, sensory, neurological, psychological, "
"and beyond. If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this "
"class and feel that accommodations could help you learn more, contact the Disability Resource "
Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable 
"accommodations. The DRC is located in 116 Smith Memorial Student Union, 503 -725-4150, "
"drc@pdx .edu, https://wwwLinks to an external site..pdx.edu/drc.  "
"If you already have accommodations, please contact me to make sure that I have received a "
faculty notification letter and to discuss your accommodations.  
"For information about emergency preparednes s, please go to the Fire and Life Safety webpage "
(https://wwwLinks to an external site..pdx.edu/environmental -health -safety/fire -and-life-safety) 
for information.  
 COURSE MECHANICS & POLICIES  
Student Expectations in Online Courses  
Visit our Canvas si te at least three times per week.  
Check for new announcements and Canvas mail each time you visit.  
"After checking the announcements and your Canvas mail, go directly to the current Module, "
"which you can find under the Content menu. If you just follow the Module as it's written, it will "
"take you through each reading, video, activity, quiz, and assignment .   "
DO NOT simply rely on what your Canvas Dashboard says you need to do. Why? The dashboard 
only tracks certain required activities. It is not reliable for staying on top of readings and 
participating in group work.  
"Each week begins Monday and ends Sunday . Each week is divided into two or three portions, "
"one section includes the things to complete by Monday of that week, and the other includes the "
"things to complete by Wednesday. Occasionally, I may assign a Friday deadline.  "
"If you are unfamiliar with Canv as, or if you find it frustrating to use, watch the free tutorials: "
https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Contingency -Resources/Getting -Started -with -Canvas -as-
a-Student -Videos/ba -p/256768Links to an external site.  
"If something weird is happening with Canvas, contact the IT Help Desk: "
http://www.pdx.edu/oit/.  
Turning Things in on Canvas  
"You may submit a writing assignment as a .docx, .doc, .rtf, .txt, .ppt, .pptx, or .pdf as well as "
"through several video, image, and audio formats if they are under 5GB. If yo u upload a file in an "
"unsupported format, I will not be able to open your documents and grade your work properly in "
the Canvas system.  
Do not upload anything as .pages or .gdoc. If you use Pages or Google Docs/Slides to compose 
"your work, that is fine, but  you need to save it as a PDF and upload that version if you want to "
"get a grade on it. Sadly, Canvas simply cannot open those types of files. The good news is that "
"you can easily save things from those applications as PDFs.  If and only if the file for the  assignment is too large to upload, then save the file to your Google "
"Drive, share it with me, and post the link in the assignment box. I will not be able to use most of "
"the Canvas tools to provide feedback on it, but at least I will be able to see and gra de it.  "
It is your responsibility to make sure that you have correctly uploaded your assignment in a 
readable format to the appropriate Canvas assignment folder.  
"If you upload the assignment in the wrong format and don't fix it before the due date, it wil l "
"receive a zero. If you resubmit the assignment in the correct format after the due date, the "
assignment will be subject to the lateness policy.  
"If you have problems uploading assignments, contact the Help Desk at help@pdx.edu, 503 -725-"
4357.  
Grading Poli cies 
"Late Assignments: Unless you have received an extension from me before the due date, "
assignments turned in after the deadline will be docked points as follows:  
"If the assignment is less than a day (24 hours) late, it will be reduced by 1 letter grad e (10 "
percentage points).  
Assignments more than a day late will be reduced by 10 percentage points per day.  
Grading and Feedback: I aim for my grading turnaround time to be one to two weeks from the 
"due date. If you haven't seen a grade after two weeks, c ontact me to see if I've missed it or if "
you've incorrectly submitted it.  
"The best time to seek feedback is while you are working on a project, i.e. before you turn it in "
"for a grade. After you ’ve turned in an assignment, feedback comes in multiple forms.  One "
obvious bit of feedback is your grade. Assignments may also receive freeform feedback on 
"Canvas in a box called “feedback, ” but that ’s kind of misleading because feedback can be "
"provided in other ways, too. For example, an assignment might be scored o n a rubric, which you "
can view to get a general idea about how well the work met each of the assignment ’s various 
"requirements. Instructors can also provide feedback directly on the document you submitted, so "
"you should look for that, too. Finally, you can  get additional feedback by asking your instructor "
for it.   
I want to emphasize that it is your responsibility to seek out any additional guidance or 
"feedback you need. I want you to be successful, and I need your input and direction to support "
"you in that  goal. If you aren ’t getting what you need from me or the class, tell me and be direct "
"about it. Even if you don ’t know what you need, but feel like you don ’t fully understand an "
"assignment, a grade, or the feedback I provide, reach out because I might hav e some ideas "
about how to clarify or adjust things.  
"If you find yourself falling behind in your work, please contact me before the assignment is due "
and accommodations will be considered on a case -by-case basis. Late assignments may not 
receive instructor  comments and may be docked points as described above  
Communication  
"Email: When emailing in any professional or educational context, begin by indicating in the "
"subject line that this is for UNST 254O. Yes, please indicate the specific course number with the "
"letter. I teach multiple classes and I need to know which one you are in. Also, include a clue "
"about your purpose in the subject line. Then, you should include a salutation, something like, "
"“Hi Dr. Sommariva. ” Emails in the same chain don ’t necessarily  require you to keep saying, “hi,” "
but the first one really should.  
Availability: Expect that it may take me a full business day to respond to your email. Why? This 
is because I am contracted to work 9 -10 hours per week per 4 -credit class and I am often a way 
"from my phone and computer during meals and other non -work times, Sometimes I can "
"respond almost immediately, but many times I cannot. If you don ’t hear back from me within "
"that time, please reach out a second time to make sure that I got your email. B elieve me, you "
would not be “bugging ” me. I just get tons of emails and sometimes things get buried or I 
accidentally delete something. I always appreciate follow -up emails from students.  
"Individual meetings: If you want to talk with me one -on-one, I ’m ve ry happy to schedule "
something with you. Just visit my Calendly account where you can find learn when I'm available 
and request a specific time slot for a 10 - or 30 -minute meeting: 
"https://calendly.com/amisommariva. Unless otherwise discussed and confirmed , we'll meet "
over Zoom at this link: https://pdx.zoom.us/j/2456877527.   
Plagiarism  
Plagiarism is taking another person's work and using it as your own. When writers use material 
"from other sources, they must acknowledge this source. Not doing so is call ed plagiarism, which "
means using without credit the ideas or expressions of another. You are therefore cautioned 
against using  
"1. Phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc., word -for-word, without acknowledgment, from the "
written material of others;  
"2. Phrases,  sentences, paragraphs, etc., with only slight changes to the written materials of "
another; and  
"3. The general plan, the main headings, or a rewritten form of someone else's material. These "
cautions apply to the work of other students as well as to the pu blished work of professional or 
amateur writers.  
"If you submit someone else's writing or ideas as your own, you will fail the assignment and may "
fail the class. It is against the PSU Code of Conduct to submit the same assignment for multiple 
"courses. If y ou are caught plagiarizing, I will also forward your name to the college's student "
conduct office for further Action. Learning how to separate your ideas and words from those of 
"others -- ensuring proper credit to everyone involved -- is a goal of this cla ss. When in doubt, "
ask me.  
See PSU Student Code of Conduct for a complete list of policies related to student conduct at 
PSU: https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -code -student -conduct -and-responsibility  
" Mutual Respect, Privacy, and Mandatory Repo rting  "
"As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my "
students and the campus as a whole. We expect a culture of mutual respect in our department 
"and in every course. But what is mutual respect, exactly? W hat does it look like in an online "
"course? To begin with, mutual respect is demonstrated by active listening, expressing "
"appreciation for each person's contribution, communicating directly and honestly, offering "
"grace, seeking to understand rather than jud ge, and respecting one another's boundaries.  "
"In that spirit of mutual respect, I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything, "
especially about anything in the course that negatively affects you. There is no topic that I 
"consider off -limits, an d I consider this part of my job as a faculty member in a department "
"whose mission includes provoking ""students to build self -efficacy through relational learning "
"across difference,"" (""About UNST,"" UNST Website, https://www.pdx.edu/university -"
"studies/about -unst, accessed 1/3/24).  "
"Please be aware, however, that as a faculty member, I am legally mandated to report any "
"instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination "
to either the Office of Equity and Compliance or the Office of the Dean of Student Life. If you 
would rather share information about sexual harassment or sexual violence to a confidential 
"employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can talk with an Interpersonal "
Violence Advocate at the Women ’s Resource Cente r or the Queer Resource Center. You may 
contact a confidential advocate by calling 503 -725-5672. This Sexual Misconduct Website 
provides a complete of those confidential employees and off -campus resources:

COURSE DESCRIPTION  
This year -long course examines the nature and state of healthy individuals and 
populations in their various environments. A dynamic approach will be used to study the 
"places in which people live and interact, such as the community, the workplace, and the "
natural environment. Specific emphasis will be given to social determinants of health and 
"the intersections between health, communities (local and global), and human "
rights.   Topics will focus on ways to examine and address problems that affect health and 
"well-being, ethics, and how social issues have a role to play in health outcomes. "
Professional development in the health context will also be addressed. The Fall Term will 
"examine these topics through Poverty, Income Disparities, the Food Gap, and other "
related issues.  
The Winter Course is divided into 3 Modules:  
• Module 1 – HHHR Roots of Research (3 Weeks)  
We'll be taking on the key building blocks making up the roots of research and 
"will explore using health data, human rights data, and happiness data.   You'll "
begin forming the frame for your own research project due by the end of the 
term.   2 
 • Module 2 – HHHR Deep Dive (4 Weeks)  
"We'll explore the concepts of Health, Happiness and Human Rights through "
"the lens of a critically acclaimed book  ""Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest "
"of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World.""  Key concepts include "
"issues of access to health care and the global distribution of wealth, plaguing "
"the poorest people. You will keep a journal as you read this book, and provide "
your choice of assignment reflection.   
• Module 3 – HHHR Research Project (3 weeks)  
"You'll be developing your own Health, Happiness and Human RIghts research "
project to finish up this term and add to your growing ePortfolio projects. 
You'll have options in terms of how you want to present your research 
project.   
COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES:  
"By the end of this three -term course, students will be able to:  "
1. Explain social determinants of health using their own words  
"2. Demonstrate the ability to recognize and evaluate assumptions, the primary "
"alternative points of view and related theories, principles, and ideas relevant "
"to the question, issue, and problem and discern how to apply strengths in "
finding solutions  
3. Explain ethical issues that arise during research  
4. Use systematic inquiry skills to assess neighborhood health  
5. Demonstrate the ability to use information effectively and follow formal and 
informal expectations for written and oral communication to develop and 
explore ideas  
6. Evaluate change in their understanding of health  
7. Apply teamwork skills to support a constructive interdisciplinary climate 
conducive to accomplishing tasks  
8. Improve intercultural communication in issues related to health  
Course Format:  This is an online course divided into three modules. The system will 
"combine discussions, activities, lectures, team projects, papers, and student "
"presentations. We will have an optional synchronous meeting each week, where you can "
do your course discussio n for the week as an option rather than posting to the weekly 
discussion boards. You will also be able to meet once a week with your Peer Mentor. 
Peer Mentors are upper -division PSU students trained to assist with this course. During 
"Mentor sessions, you w ill build on the work introduced by your instructor, participate in "
"team projects, learn and review skills in research, writing, and other areas, and engage in "
other assignments or projects as assigned by your Mentor.  You will have coursework 
posted by yo ur mentor that will be graded as a part of this class.  3 
" During the fall term,  we’ll establish the foundation for our understanding of Health, "
"Happiness, and Human Rights in the context of our class. We’ll practice some of the "
techniques to produce solid academic writing. We’ll brush up on our research skills. And 
we’ll put into acti on what we’ve been learning by the end of the course.  
"During the winter term,  we’ll engage in hands -on research and investigation of specific "
instances of health concerns. We will explore various aspects of global injustice through 
"research. To assist our study, we will research an issue you are deeply concerned about "
and relate to our course theme.  
"During the spring  term,  we will engage in a community -based learning project. Thus, we "
will keep developing our understanding of diverse perspectives and empathy. Regarding 
"skills, you will work on communicating your experience,  leading class discussions,  and "
"determining ways to seek positive, proactive change in Health, Happiness, and Human "
Rights. You will be wrapping up the year with your Pebblepad portfolio project  
Freshman/First -Year Inquiry (FRINQ) and its Goals     
FRINQ’s yearlong approach to learning differs from many other educational programs. It 
"is based on collaboration and commitment among the faculty, peer mentors, and "
students in creating and developing a learning community characterized by respect and 
respo nsibility and combining collective and individual participation. The goals of 
University Studies (FRINQ is only your first step) are to develop and strengthen 
metacognitive and other skills beneficial to your academic success and lifelong 
aspirations.  
The four goals are:  
• Inquiry & Critical Thinking : Students will learn various modes of inquiry 
"through interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, "
"conceptualizing —to become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
• Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in 
"various ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —"
to collaborate effectively with others in group work and to be competent in 
appropriate communication technologies.  
"• Diversity, Equity, & Social Justice:  Students will explore and analyze identity, "
"power relationships, and social justice from multiple perspectives in historical "
contexts and contemporary settings.  
"• Ethics, Agency, & Community : Students will examine values, theories, and "
practices that inform their actions and reflect on how personal choices and 
group decisions impact local and global communities.  
More on the University Studies goals: https://www.pdx.edu/university -studies/program -
learning -goals  More about Freshman Inquiry:  https://www.pdx.edu/university -
studies/freshman -inquiry.  
  4 
" These four general goals constitute the necessary conditions for achievement in college, "
"community activism, and a broad array of professions. FRINQ classes approach the goals "
from an interdisciplinary perspective in preparation for more advanced study. 
"Furthermore, the course encourages students to embrace various cultural practices and "
critical modes of thought.  
  Course Requirements :  
• Work on your Canvas Course at least three times each week. This may include 
"attending your instructor’s synchronous session, participating in the weekly "
"online discussion, interacting with your peer mentor and other students in this "
"class, and submitting y our weekly assignments.  "
"• You are expected to read, watch, or listen to the assigned materials each week "
to complete your assignments successfully. Look at the assignments each 
"week to find the resources you are being asked to read, watch or listen to for "
a given week.   
• All assignments are to be submitted typewritten unless otherwise noted. 
"Make sure to back up your work on your Google Drive or elsewhere, as you "
may want various projects for your ePortfolio at the end of the year. Your 
peer mentor Maria will be your guide  to getting your ePortfolio completed. 
"Check Canvas's modules and class schedule for weekly readings, assignments, "
etc. Students are responsible for tracking due dates.  
"• Grading: As with any course, to pass, students must complete at least 70% of "
the coursework (equivalent to a C -) and attend class by doing work multiple 
times each week through Canvas. Attendance and Participation policies are 
explained in this course desc ription. See PSU’s grading system  here . 
Required Course Materials  
CANVAS: Your course can be found here <  https://canvas.pdx.edu/

PebblePad: <  pebblepad.pdx.edu  > Each term you will work on your ePortfolio. By 
"spring, you’ll complete an ePortfolio of your work.  "
Portland State Writing Center <  http://www.writingcenter.pdx.edu/ > For writing 
support  
Purdue Online Writing Center (OWL) <  https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/  > A 
nationally recognized writing resource.  
Written Work :  All of your work each week will be due by Sunday at midnight. Your 
"course discussion posts are initially due on Fridays, and your response posts are "
scheduled by Sundays.   
"PSU’s standard formula  for planning homework: for each credit hour you are in class, "
estimate that you’ll need to devote 2 hours to work outside of class . (This being a 5 -
"credit hour class, that’s 10 hours a week.) This is an average —some weeks, you may find "
"you don’t have a lot of coursework, and others (especially during midterms and finals), "
you may feel there aren’t enough hours in the day. If you stru ggle with meeting all the 
"demands, reach out to your Peer Mentor and me, as we often help students with this.  "
E-Portfolio  
The E -Portfolio is a requirement for all Freshman Inquiry Courses. The portfolio is a 
collection of digital media files that represent your coursework and achievements. You 
are required to keep a portfolio of your work for this class throughout the entire year. 
Your mentor will guide you through the process of developing an E -Portfolio during your 
peer mentor sessions. You will start this process in the Fall Term and turn in your 
finished E Portfolio at the end of the Spring Term. Your peer mentor will be a n excellent 
resource on this project.  You will be expected to have developed the frame for the E -
Portfolio and have addressed at least one of the UNST goals in it this term. Your peer 
mentor will track your progress on your e -portfolio. Your work -in-progre ss will be 
reviewed by your instructor periodically.  
Community Learning (Extra Credit)  
You have an opportunity to earn up to 10 points in extra credit sometime during the 
term for completing a   community learning activity. This could be participating in a day -
of-service on the PSU campus or some other volunteer opportunity of your choosing. If 
"you are interested in earning extra credit, propose your extra credit project to your 6 "
 professor prior to completing it via email or during office hours. Extra credit assignments 
must be pre -approved in order to earn the additional points.   
GENERAL POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS  
Attendance and Participation  
"You are expected to sign into this course online each week, both relating to the "
instructor’s session (either attend live or watch it recorded) and the peer mentor 
availability. You will earn up to 10 participation points per week for participating in the 
primary course materials (this will be done primarily through your online discussion posts 
or by attending a synchronous online session with your instructor.   You will earn 
additional participation points per week for participating in the activities in the  peer 
mentor sessions.  
Late Assignments  
"You will be expected to turn in your assignments by the due dates. However, you can "
still submit your work for reduced points if you miss a deadline. These are decreased 
"weekly (5% first week late, 10% second week late, etc.)   You cannot turn in late work "
"one month after it is due. If your assignment is not in within four weeks, you will receive "
"0 points. If you have extenuating circumstances (i.e., medical emergency, family issues, "

between the student and instructor.  
4. There is a signed contract:  Guidelines and Contract for Assigning an

Communication  
Your communication with me as your instructor should be respectful and reflect that of a 
"responsible college student. You should avoid using slang terms, derogatory terms, and "
"expletives (curse words, etc.). The best ways to communicate with Dr. Neiworth a re: "
1. Text Messaging is the fastest (for quick questions). You can text Dr. Neiworth 
at 971 -990-5260 
2. Email Messages will be returned generally in 24 – 48 hours. You can email 
Dr. Neiworth at:  latrissa@pdx.edu  
2. Office Hours is another way of seeking more transparent communication. Dr. 
"Neiworth, as does your peer mentor, has office hours available every week. "
Seek out those times or schedule an appointment with questions or concerns.  
"For more ideas on how to write formal emails, review these resources:   "

class Google group or direct email to contact you about crucial course -related 
information.  
PSU POLICIES  8 
 Discrimination  
Portland State is committed to providing an environment free of prohibited 
"discrimination and sexual harassment (sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, "
"gender or sex -based harassment, and stalking). If you have experienced sexual "
"harassment, know th at help and support are available. PSU has staff members trained to "
"support survivors in navigating campus life, providing academic support, and more. "
"Information about PSU’s support services on campus, including  confidential "
"services  and reporting options , can be found on PSU’s  Sexual "
"Misconduct  Response  website,  or you may call a Confidential Advocate at "
503.894.7982 or schedule  online . You may also report any incident of discrimination or 
"discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, to the  Title IX "
"Coordinator , Office of Equity and Compliance , or the  Office of the Dean of  Student "
Life. 
Please be aware that all PSU faculty members and instructors  must report  information of 
"an incident that may constitute prohibited discrimination, including sexual harassment "
and sexual and relationship violence. This means that if you tell me about a situation of 
"sexual harassment or discrimination, I have to share the inform ation with the University’s "
"Title IX Coordinator or the Office of the Dean of Student Life.   However, the information "
will be kept private and only those with a need to know will be provided with what you 
disclose.  
You may also report sexual and relationship violence to law enforcement on campus 
with  Campus  Public Safety Office (CPSO).  Or you may file an  anonymous report with 
Campus Public Safety Office  or a Bias Incident report  with the  Bias Review Team 
(BRT).   PSU does not typically investigate the reports that are made through these two 
avenues. These reports help PSU understand what students and employees are 
experiencing on and around campus and provide support where needed.  
As with all other classes at PSU conduct questions not explicitly covered by this syllabus 
are covered by PSU’s Code:  www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -code -student -
conduct -and-responsibility  
Academic Integrity  
All of the work you turn -in must be your own and must be produced for this particular 
course. Turning in work submitted for another course will result in a zero for that 
"assignment. Plagiarism is a serious violation.   Copying someone else’s work, cutting a nd "
"pasting from the Internet, and using quotes or ideas in a paper without providing proper "
citations are all examples of plagiarism. Plagiarism will result in a zero on the assignment 
"and can result in further sanctions, including up to dismissal from Por tland State "
"University. To learn more about what constitutes plagiarism, view this library "
tutorial:   http://guides.library.pdx.edu/content.php?pid=354274&sid=2907105.

• copying the homework of someone else  
• submitting for credit work done by someone else (include plagiarism and 
"paraphrasing without citing sources , and use of AI ) "
• stealing examinations or course materials  
"• tampering with the University's grade records , or with another student's "
work 
• knowingly and intentionally assisting another student in any of the above  
"If you are unsure of whether or not academic misconduct has occurred, the "
Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards is available for a 
"consultation, which may involve reviewing student -submitted material or the "
situation to determine if it violates any aspect of the code and if a complaint 
should be submitted.

Fall Quarter: 01/08/24 - 03/17/24 
Attendance:  
We’re are (still) in a pandemic  and while I want you to take care of yourselves 
"and your community , attending class is an important part of learning and "
engaging with our community. Each student ha s two (2) unexcused absences 
from class before absences begin to affect your grade . On top of all the things 
"that can make attendance difficult, we’re in a pandemic. If you need to miss "
class for any reason let me know prior to missing class. It’s your responsibility 
to keep up with readings and assignments. If you’re going to miss clas s 
communicate with me so we can figure out the best course of action to keep 
you on track in class.  
*If you want to attend an event (including protests) I will count it as an 
excused absence if you write a 1 -page paper (minimum 250 words) about your 
experience and how it relates to the class. This paper is due the following 
week. Please communicate with me prior to the event to work out the details.  
Email Etiquette:   
"When corresponding by e -mail, please do so in a professional manner. This "
"means having a n opening (e.g., “Hello Molly”) and a closing that identifies who "
"you are (“Sincerely, Larry Mlynarek”). When emailing, please put “WS -381” in the "
subject line.  I will respond to emails within 24hrs. Please also note that I may 
not check my email in the ev enings or weekends so if you need to 
"discuss/notify/or meet with me, please don’t email me at the last minute. If I "
don’t respond within 24hrs then feel free to email me again.   
Electronic Etiquette :  
"I am not here to police you. I ask that you please not  use cell phones, "
"tablets, etc., in class. Please silence and put away cell phones for the duration "
"of class. You are all adults and are responsible for your own education, but it "
goes without saying that constantly looking at your phone during class will affect 
your ability to participate and that will affect your grade.  Assignments:  
"• All papers must use Times New Roman font, 12 -point, double -spaced, 1-"
"inch margins,  "
"with all references cited using Chicago, MLA, or APA citation style. Please "
make sure your papers have been edited for spelling and grammar  
• I have flexibility regarding late assignments. For late assignments  you’ll 
lose 1% per day that the assignment is l ate. 1-week late (7 days) = -7% 
"2-weeks late (14 days) = -14%, etc. If you want to avoid losing points "
you must communicate with me regarding your late/missing assignments.  
• You are still responsible for turning in assignments on days you are 
absent. 
Grading:  
• Attendance and Participation 30% (20% main session; 10% mentor session)  
• Entry/Exit Tickets 20%  
• Research Proposal  5% 
• Podcast 15%  
• Final 30% 
"Attendance & Participation 30% - “Nobody knows everything, together we know a "
lot.” My learning and teaching style involves in -depth discussion and participation. 
We learn in community with each other. Some of the texts we’ll be reading and 
discussing will be difficult and thus attendance in class is necessary. Participation 
"can look like many different things: participating in small group discussion, "
"speaking in class, engaged listening, respecting others who are speaking (not on "
"your phone or laptop), ice breaker prompts, etc.  "
Entry/Exit Tickets 20% - At the start and close of each class students will ha ve 
10-12min to fill out an entry and exit ticket. A different entry/exit prompt will be 
given each day. It is your responsibility to fill out and turn in your entry/exit 
ticket. I will provide a small notebook that will be passed out and picked up 
before and after the entry and exit prompt. Entry/Exit tickets are due the day of 
and cannot be turn in late. Not including the first and last week there are 16 
days of class which means 16 entry ticket and 16 exit tickets (this will be 
adjusted if class is cancel led for whatever reason).  
Each ticket is worth 2 points (4 points possible for the day). You will receive 1 
point for a basic response that do not reference class readings or themes. You 
will receive 2 points for a thoughtful response that references clas s readings and themes. While this assignment allows for a possible maximum of 64 points this 
assignment will be out of 50 points. This means you can miss up to 3.5 days 
of entry/exit tickets (or 7 entry/exit tickets total) without it affecting your grade. 
"Obviously, this means that your attendance will affect your Entry/Exit Ticket "
grade. 
Research Project Proposal  5%- Each student is responsible for submitting a 
research project proposal. In this proposal you will address the topic you are 
"proposing to rese arch, your reason for choosing this topic, 2 -3 research "
"questions, and at least 10 keywords that will be part of your search.  "
Podcast and Podcast Reflection 15%- Students can work with one to two other 
people (co-hosts) on this project but all students must be present in the podcast 
at proportional rates. Student’s will make a 7 -10min (for 2 co -host podcast) or 
12-15min (for 3 co -host podcast) podcast discussing th eir final paper with their 
podcast group.  
Each of you is working on a research project that will be your final project. For 
the podcast talk to your co -hosts about your project. What’s interesting? What 
have you learned? Engage each other in conversation.  Each person will talk 
about their project and as a group you will engage in conversations about each 
"person’s projects. That might look like others adding information, asking questions, "
"addressing current events that relate to someone’s project, or connecting your "
projects together.  
You will not be judged on the quality of recording (but we must be able to 
understand/hear it). Your podcast should have a name and you should introduce 
yourselves at the start. We will listen to everyone’s podcast during the last week 
of class. Your grade  will be decided by your classmates and myself.  
"Final 30% - For your final, you will write a research paper on the topic you "
chose from your research proposal.  
More detail about paper requirements will be given in a separate document.  
Grading Scale:  
The following will be the grading scale: A = 94 -100 %; A- = 90-93%; B+ = 
87-89%; B = 84 -86%; B- = 80-83%; C+ = 77 -79%; C = 74 -76%; C- = 70-73%; 
D+ = 67-69%; D = 64 -66%; D- = 60-63%; F = 59 and below  Schedule  
Schedule (Note that this schedule is subject to  change) 
*This class will be organized around a Tuesday/Thursday Schedule. When 
coming to class you are expected to have read the readings listed on 
that day in the syllabus. For example:  
Tuesday- Read: “We Do This ‘Til We Free Us”  
Thursday- Read: “Are Pr isons Obsolete”

Course
Description
Our
Freshman
Inquiry
is
a
"yearlong,"
interdisciplinary
class
that
uses
the
University
Studies
goals
Inquiry
and
Critical
"Thinking,"
"Communication,"
"Diversity,"
"Equity,"
and
Social
"Justice,"
and
"Ethics,"
"Agency,"
and
Community
to
explore
the
subject
of
PORTLAND.
In
this
"course,"
you
will
explore
the
city
and
ideas
related
to
"place,"
"placemaking,"
and
what
it
means
to
be
a
citizen
now
and
in
the
past.
You
will
practice
"writing,"
research
and
critical
"thinking,"
setting
you
up
for
success
in
your
college
career
(and
your
life).
FRINQ
courses
take
an
inquiry-based
approach
to
"learning,"
asking
you
to
pose
questions
and
explore
"answers,"
using
curiosity
as
your
guide
.
You
will
learn
how
to
research
ideas
and
"information,"
and
how
to
write
and
communicate
in
a
variety
of
styles.
You
will
also
develop
various
tools
to
help
you
analyze
what
you
"read,"
"hear,"
and
see.
Inquiry
involves
a
constant
and
active
conversation
between
"reading,"
"writing,"
re
and
analysis.
For
this
"course,"
our
texts
will
include
not
only
"books,"
"articles,"
"videos,"
and
"images,"
but
also
the
"spaces,"
"places,"
and
people
around
us.
This
"fall,"
we
will
focus
on
how
to
use
primary
"sources,"
such
as
"newspapers,"
"magazines,"
historical
"documents,"
and
maps.
Some
questions
we’ll
consider
include:
What
elements
have
created
the
Portland
we
live
in
now?
What
is
“sense
of
place”
and
what
is
its
importance?
How
do
we
investigate
and
understand
historical
change
in
a
city?
What
does
it
mean
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
city?
Students
with
diverse
backgrounds
and
experiences
come
together
to
take
this
"class,"
and
everyone
is
encouraged
to
share
their
experiences
with
the
class.
Main
sessions
will
consist
primarily
of
instructor-facilitated
discussions
and
student-facilitated
discussions.
It
is
critical
that
you
come
to
class
prepared
to
engage
in
an
active
discussion
with
the
class.
1
Every
class
has
a
set
of
values
that
drive
"it,"
both
explicitly
and
implicitly.
Understanding
and
articulating
these
"values,"
such
as
we
"can,"
is
a
useful
process
in
order
to
answer
the
"questions,"
“Why
are
we
here?
Why
is
this
important?
How
does
this
material
impact
me
and
my
communities?”
As
the
course
spools
"out,"
these
ideas
will
develop.
But
to
"begin,"
I
give
you
these
ideas
about
what
I
hope
you
get
from
the
course:
1.
Learn
to
respect
your
intellectual
life
and
education
as
a
gift
that
no
one
can
steal
from
"you,"
and
of
which
you
are
the
chief
agent.
2.
Learn
how
your
everyday
life
is
connected
to
historical
systems
of
"oppression,"
like
"racism,"
colonialism
and
sexism.
3.
Understand
how
you
can
"connect,"
through
your
thinking
and
writing
and
"talking,"
both
inside
and
outside
the
"class,"
ideas
of
personal
and
community
responsibilities
for
historical
systems
of
hierarchy
and
"power,"
including
both
bene
and
su
4.
Learn
to
use
and
respect
your
voice
as
an
agent
of
"change,"
as
you
see
it.
5.
Work
at
your
highest
level
in
this
course
through
respecting
your
own
e
rising
to
external
challenges
and
recognizing
internal
challenges.
6.
Make
connections
between
your
lived
experiences
and
the
material
&
processes
of
the
class.
Recognize
the
skills
you
are
learning
and
their
applicability
in
both
your
academic
and
professional
lives.
Course
Policies
Come
to
class
prepared
to
participate
and
engage
with
your
classmates.
Please
bring
a
notebook
and
"pen/pencil,"
and
your
readings/assignments
for
that
day.
Your
attendance
and
participation
are
welcome
and
valued.
Turn
your
phone’s
noti
o
and
put
it
in
your
"bag,"
out
of
your
"sight,"
during
class.
There
will
be
times
when
we
will
use
our
phones
in
"class,"
so
you
are
encouraged
to
bring
it.
You
are
welcome
to
take
notes
on
your
"laptop,"
but
please
stay
focused
on
course
work
if
you
choose
to
use
a
laptop
during
class.
If
you
come
to
class
and
do
not
"participate,"
you
will
not
get
credit
for
that
day’s
work.
You
will
gain
the
most
from
this
course
if
you
attend
and
participate
in
every
class.
If
you
get
"sick,"
email
me
and
let
me
know
what’s
happening.
Your
attendance
will
be
taken
for
both
the
main
and
mentored
classes.
Course
Outcomes/Learning
Objectives
Everything
we
do
in
this
class
connects
to
the
UNST
goals.
You
will
think
"critically,"
e
communicate
your
ideas
and
listen
to
the
ideas
of
"others,"
explore
issues
of
equity
and
"diversity,"
and
consider
how
our
own
sense
of
agency
impacts
our
communities.
2University
Studies
Goals
:
This
course
is
the
introductory

"program,"
which
has
four
central
goals:
●
Inquiry
and
Critical
Thinking:

learn
various
modes
of
inquiry
through

"investigating,"
conceptualizing—in
order
to
become
"active,"
"self-motivated,"
and
empowered
learners.
●
Communication
:
Students
will
enhance
their
capacity
to
communicate
in
various
"ways—writing,"
"graphics,"
"numeracy,"
and
other
visual
and
oral
means—to
collaborate
e
with
others
in
group
"work,"
and
to
be
competent
in
appropriate
communication
technologies.
●
Diversity
","
Equity
and
Social
Justice
:
Students
will
explore
and
analyze
"identity,"
power
"relationships,"
and

justice
in
historical
contexts
and
contemporary
settings
from
multiple
perspectives.
●
"Ethics,"
"Agency,"
and
Community:
Students
will
examine
"values,"
theories
and
practices
that

their
"actions,"
and
re
on
how
personal
choices
and
group
decisions

Attendance
and
Deadlines
Come
to
every
class
and
mentor
session.
An
essential
element
of
your
learning
this
year
is
to
prioritize
your
"work,"
and
e
manage
your
time.
If
you
miss
"class,"
gather
notes
about
the
class
from
a
classmate
or
the
mentor.
My
expectations
for
your
attendance
and
deadlines
in
the
class
are
designed
to
help
you
keep
up
and
learn.
If
you
need
accommodations
for
any
due
"date,"
please
discuss
it
with
me
in
person.
If
you
have
an
"emergency,"
please
email
me
and
let
me
know
what’s
happening.
More
communication
is
better!
Attendance
is
worth
30%
of
your
grade.
Missing
more
than
2
class
or
mentor
sessions
will
begin
to
impact
your
attendance
grade
for
the
course.
See
the
details
below
under
“Why
you
will
suggest
your
own
grade
for
our
course”
for
examples
of
how
attendance
at
main
and
mentor
sessions
is
integral
to
your
course
grade.
What
does
engagement
in
the
class
mean?
Engagement
comes
in
many
"forms,"
not
just
attendance.
Taken
"holistically,"
engagement
includes
(but
is
not
limited
to)
the
following:
Preparation
(reviewing
readings
and
material
before
class)
Focus
(avoiding
distractions
during
in-person
and
online
activities)
4Presence
(engaged
and
responsive
during
group
activities)
Asking
questions
(in
"class,"
out
of
"class,"
"online,"
o
Listening
(hearing
what
others
"say,"
and
also
what
they’re
not
saying)
Speci
(referring
to
speci
ideas
from
readings
and
discussions)
Synthesizing
(making
connections
between
readings
and
discussions)
Plan
to
attend
every
class
and
every
mentor
session.
Missing
class
or
mentor
session
will
impact
the
framework
for
your
""
grade
(see
below).
If
you
have
to
miss
"class,"
send
me
an
email
or
text
to
let
me
know
what
is
going
"on,"
and
gather
material
you
missed
from
a
classmate
or
mentor.

*Unless
otherwise
"indicated,"
all
assignments
are
due
by
Sunday
at
11:59
of
the
week
they
are
assigned.*
Assignment
Format
All
instructions
for
assignments
will
be
posted

Canvas
in
the
weekly
modules.
Please
keep
your
assignments
organized
in
a
single
Google
folder
called
“Your
last
name_Portland”
and
share
this
with
me
(
leufusia@pdx.edu
).
You
will
turn
the
URL
of
your
folder
into
Canvas
when
you
complete
an
"assignment,"
so
we
have
all
that
info
in
one
place.
It
will
also
make
giving
and
getting
feedback
much
easier.
Generally
"speaking,"
I
will
not
require
you
to
print
your
assignments.
All
assignments
for
each
week
are
due
Sunday
night
by
11:59
pm.
Instructor
Availability
I
am
available
weekdays
during
business
"hours,"
9:00
am
–
4:00
"pm,"
via
email.
If
you
need
to
schedule
an
on-campus
"meeting,"
Zoom
"meeting,"
or

out
and
we
can
set
something
up.
I
encourage
frequent
"communication,"
so
please
don’t
hesitate
to
be
in
touch.
I
also
expect
a
timely
response
to
any
email
I
send
to
"you,"
so
please
respond
within
24
hours
if
you
get
an

from
me.
Required
Materials
For
this
term
assigned
readings/materials
are
available
through
the
PSU
library
or
online
at
no
cost.
These
course
materials
are
on
Canvas
under
the
weekly
modules
and
you
can
view
the
materials
in
the
Course
"Schedule,"
which
you
can
link
to
from
Canvas.
5Please
be
prepared
to
read
actively
and
engage
with
materials.
Set
up
a
plan
to:
●
Keep
track
of
notes
and
organize
them
in
a
way
that
you
can
""
them
●
Keep
track
of
course
materials
and
the
course
schedule
●
Devote
speci
time
to
working
on
this
course
Workload
and
Our
Time
It
is
important
to
be
able
to
budget
your
time
for
this
class
by
thinking
through
the
time
you
will
need
to
complete
your
work
and
build
community.
PSU
advisors
recommend
at
least
two
hours
of
study
time
per
week
for
every
credit
hour
.
For
our
class
it
looks
like
this:
Main
class:
4
hours
per
week
>>
8
hours
per
week
of
work
outside
of
class.
Mentor
session:
1
hour
per
week
>>
2
hours
of
work
out
of
class.
This
estimate
is
"generous,"
and
it
will
probably
take
you
less
time
to
complete
your
work
each
week.
A
possible
schedule
for
working
in
the
class
might
look
something
like
this:
Monday
:
Plan/read/prepare
for
mentor
and
main
session
on
Tuesday
Tuesday
:
Attend
mentor
session
and

Canvas
and
PebblePad
We
will
make
use
of
two
online
learning
platforms
this
term.
The
course
"syllabus,"
"schedule,"
"assignments,"
and
additional
resources
are
available
on
Canvas
.
You
will
also
use
a
web-based

called
PebblePad
to
help
you
re
"on,"
"collect,"
and
display
your
work
when
you
make
your
portfolio.

Academic
Integrity
Academic

means:
●
All
of
the
work
you
turn-in
must
be
your
own
and
must
be
produced
for
this
particular
course.
Turning
in
work
that
was
submitted
for
another
"course,"
will
result
in
a
zero
for
that
assignment.
●
Plagiarism
is
a
serious
violation.
Copying
someone

"work,"
cutting
and
pasting
from

Internet
and
using
quotes
or
ideas
in
a
paper
without
providing
proper
citation
are
all
examples
of
plagiarism.
Plagiarism
will
result

In this course, we will use the city of Portland to uncover how the place we live in shapes our lives, and how we, in turn, shape the places. We will examine the city as a context for human development and cultural expression; as an urban area of diverse communities; as part of the larger natural, material, and social environment of the Pacific Northwest; as a political, economic, and cultural entity within the United States of America; and as a site of global capitalist production. We will discuss what connects us to our place(s) as well as what makes place(s) part of our social, cultural, spiritual, economic and political life.  We will read broadly, touching on multiple disciplines and perspectives. We will use the city as our laboratory as we explore the communities and spaces of greater Portland. Course Outcomes/Learning Objectives The Four University Studies Learning Goals:  University Studies courses focus on four main learning goals.  Throughout this course, you will develop your skills in these areas:  "
Figure 1 Parody Movie Poster by David Walker  
"Page 2 of 7 Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways—writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies. Critical Thinking and Inquiry: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula—problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners. Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives. Ethics, Agency and Community: Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities. UNST Mission: Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry-based pedagogy: • provokes students to build self-efficacy through relational learning across difference • encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for transformative learning • advances civic engagement, reflective practice, and the scholarship of teaching and learning UNST Vision: Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously in imagining and co-creating a just world. Technology Recording Technology Notice We may use appropriate technologies for taking notes in this course. Our use of such technology is governed by FERPA, the Acceptable Use Policy and PSU’s Student Code of Conduct. We will not share recordings of class activities nor contents of our Google Drive outside of course participants, which include your fellow students, TAs/GAs/Mentors, and any guest faculty or community-based learning partners that we may engage with. You may not share recordings outside this course. Doing so may result in disciplinary action.   Major Assignments Attendance -  DUE Daily Participation – DUE Daily  "

You will find everything you need in our Class Drive… daily class documents, readings, resources, etc. Each of you will have your own turn-in folder where you will, as the name suggests, turn in all your work. This material is not to be shared outside of our class community. Talk to me if you have any questions or concerns about use of the Drive.  Grading Criteria I have structured the course in an intentional fashion in order to create a vibrant and supportive learning community and foster student agency in claiming your education. Students will be deeply involved in assessing their performance and learning over the course of the term and selecting their grade. Course assignments will encourage a reflective learning practice that facilitates a deeper processing of course concepts and which encourages connection to real world issues. This structure is reflective of a commitment to the values of democracy, horizontalism in the classroom, decentralization, interdisciplinarity, and a rich form of participation, which I hope will provide for a dynamic learning experience. In line with the aim of taking agency over your education you will determine your own grade at the end of term, with input from the mentor and I. Along the way, I’ll offer you qualitative feedback on your assignments and at the end of the term, you will write a reflection on your work that assesses your own performance during the term and documents your growth on the 4 UNST goals.  I am much more interested in your learning than in the grade I enter for you at the end of the term. By remaining in this course, you agree to the conditions set forth here, including the course requirements and the terms for self-assessment outlined above.   Flexibility Statement The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and/or substitute assignments and learning activities in response to institutional, weather, or class situations.  "

That’s what the points are for. • Don’t squander your points on unnecessary absences. • Other conditions requiring longer absence require an individual agreement to modify this policy.  "
"Page 5 of 7 • If you miss more than a third of a main or mentor session by being tardy or leaving early you forfeit .5 point. • If you have zero points at the end, attendance points will not affect your grade. • Your grade will be affected, positively or negatively, if you have more or less than zero attendance points. • Consult the daily agenda and make arrangements to get notes and materials from a classmate and when you must miss class.  PSU Policies and Resources Academics Academic Integrity Academic integrity is a vital part of the educational experience at PSU. The Student Code of Conduct is the university’s policy on academic dishonesty. A confirmed violation of that code in this course may result in failure of the course. Incomplete Grades Policy Students do not have a right to receive or demand an Incomplete grade. The option of assigning an Incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor when these criteria are met: • Required satisfactory course completion/participation • Reasonable justification for the request • Not sought as a substitute for a poor grade • Presence of a written agreement (such as the Incomplete Contract) • A plan in place to resolve Incomplete status The Office of the Registrar’s website has the full Incomplete Grades policy.

"Above, page from Portlandness a Cultural Atlas  by PSU authors David Banis and Hunter Shobe  "
Welcome to the second term of Portland FRINQ! This term we will explore the Portland of 
the recent past and present. What made Portland  a “model” city that was recognized for its 
innovative politics and cultural scene in the recent past? What issues and choices has Portland 
grappled with during the pandemic and social uprisings? We will address these questions and 
others through a variety  of texts and assignments meant to develop your competence in each of 
the four goal areas of the University Studies program : 
• Communication  
• Critical Thinking and Inquiry  
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice  "
"•  Ethics, Agency and Community    "
Two main texts and contexts  through which we will view the Portland:   
Charles Heying’s analysis of “Portland’s Artisan Economy” as examined in his book  Brew to Bikes   (See above)  
“Portlandness” as it is examined in  Portlandness: Reserve in the Library)  
"THIS IS AN EBOOK,  also available through the PSU library  "
Research and Inquiry  will be a central theme of this term. We will engage in traditional 
"research, using scholarly and popular sources to create a unique and compelling research "
project.   Another fundamental skill we will focus on is the “Quantitative Literacy” aspect of the 
UNST Communication goal. We will study how people communicate with numbers and 
what numbers and statistics can tell us about ourselves and the city.   
Winter Learning Objectives  
1 Develop a working knowledge of creating statistical pictures. Learn about analyzing and 
displaying data.  
2. Explore and examine narratives that attempt to conceptualize Portland as a place such as the 
concept of Artisan culture/economy as it is articulated in Charles Heying’s Brews to Bikes  and 
“Portlandness” as it is arti culated by geographers David Banis and Hunter Shobe in 
Portlandness: a Cultural Atlas.  
"3. Develop skills that inform different ways of seeing, understanding, and presenting our "
"community, including observation, discussion, research, documenting and writing , speaking, "
"surveying, experimenting, and engaging with fellow students and citizens.  "
4.  Explore what it means to do research at a college level. Read and utilize information from 
"writing texts like They Say, I Say  and Curious Researcher . "
5. Begin to fles h out and articulate a “Life Mission” by reflecting and researching your goals and 
filling out your “Professional Growth” section in the ePortfolio.  
Course Policies : 
See your fall syllabus for details. All policies remain the same.   For your convenience po licies 
have been posted in Canvas under: Course Policies.  
On Writing  
Here at PSU our writing philosophy is driven by the idea that writing is a process . This means 
that any good writer must engage in several steps to produce a good first draft and then c omplete 
a thorough revision process that will eventually produce a polished and compelling piece. In the 
words of William Cronon:  
[E] ducated people know the craft of putting words on paper. I’m not talking about parsing a 
"sentence or composing a paragraph , but about expressing what is in their minds and hearts so as "
"to teach,  persuade, and move the person who reads their words . I am talking about writing as a "
"form of touching, akin to the touching that happens in an exhilarating conversation . (Cronon   3) "
(Emphasis mine)  
One thing we will be working on throughout the term is developing your writing skills. We have 
already begun this process fall term with the use of Peer Review and my own feedback on your 
papers. This term we will engage in a more detailed  process of Peer Reviews.   Please make a 
conscious effort this term to think of your writing not as drudgery but as an art form you are 
practicing.  
Winter Term Assignments:  
Engagement and Reading Responses 15 %  of your grade  
Just like last term you will be  evaluated for your contributions and engagement in our shared 
learning community. This can take many forms but certainly showing up each time we meet and 
engaging with other students would be appreciated by all of us as we struggle to build a 
community en tirely online.  
There will be readings for most class sessions . You should post a reading response for each text . 
This term let’s challenge ourselves a bit more.  
NEW POLICY: You must post both your own original response (based on Critical Thinking not 
"your feelings please) and respond to at least one other post . In addition, I will accept a clear and "
thoughtful video response on 4 of the 10 reading responses.  YOU WILL BE ASSIGNED A TEAM TO LEAD A DISCUSSION ON ONE OF THE 
TEXTS.  
Time Management Assignment  10%  In response to your reflection papers from last term as 
"well as the course evaluations, I have included a specific assignment that asks you to think about "
"how you spend your time. It is also meant to develop your skills in quantitative literacy, "
(otherwis e known as interpreting statistical information and communicating with numbers  
Portlandness Research Proposal and Annotated Works Cited:  20%  
"For this paper, you should identify a  specific trend that Portland is known for. You will find "

"Portland State University is located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon in Multnomah County. We honor the Indigenous p eople "
"whose traditional and ancestral homelands we stand on, the Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Tumwater, Watlala bands of the "
"Chinook, the Tualatin Kalapuya and many other indigenous nations of the Columbia River. It is important to acknowledge the ance stors of "
"this place and to recognize that we are here because of the sacrifices forced upon them. In remembering these communities,  we honor "
"their legacy, their lives, and their descendants.  "
"Welcome back to your Portland FRINQ! Throughout this term, you will build on your knowledge from fall term to develop your ow n research "
"project. You will start by developing a research topic that  relates to our class theme. This is an essential part of the research process, since you "
"will use your inquiry skills to think carefully about what you want to learn and why. With guidance from me, Clover, and your  peers, you will "
"determine and refine you r topic and research question. Topics might range from community gardens, to immigration, to protest history, to "
gentrification in the city (these are just a few ideas . . .). You will conduct extensive research to first compose an annota ted bibliography a nd then 
"develop a research essay that focuses on a particular research question that relates to that topic. Finally, you will respond  to your topic creatively, "
"developing a map that reflects the theme of your essay. The purpose of the map is to encourage y ou to connect your topic to specific places, "
"communities, and people.  "
"As with fall term, this course will focus on building habits that help you become an active learner. You will continue to hav e weekly readings and "
"you will write weekly QQRs. You will a lso continue to expand your communication and critical thinking skills, and consider how issues of equity "
"and social justice inform our actions. Portland has at times been viewed as one of the most “livable” cities in the United St ates. At the same time,  "
"Portland continues to face challenges when it comes to issues such equity, housing, employment, and education. My hope is tha t you finish this "
"term with a complex understanding of the concept of “livability” as you consider issues of access, equity, and re presentation.  "
"As we continue to examine Portland this quarter, we will ask ourselves the following questions:  "
1 
"● How do people experience the city of Portland —as long -term or new residents, migrants, or visitors —and what are people’s impressions "
of the city?  
● What are the elements that make up a city and how do these elements contribute to life in the city? What do es it mean to be a “livable” 
city?  
● How can we “map” or understand different aspects of the city?  
● What are some of Portland’s assets as a city? What are some of the challenges we face and how might we address those challeng es?  
University Studies goals:  
Inquiry and Critical Thinking: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula —
"problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
"Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and "
"other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate "
communication technolog ies.  
"Diversity , Equity and Social Justice : Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in  "
historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.   
"Ethics, Agency, and Community: Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on  "
how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.   
"The topics and assignments in this class all connect to these goals. You will think critically, effectively communicate your ideas "
"and listen to the ideas of others, explore issues of equity and diversity, and consider how our own sense of agency impacts o ur "
communities.  
"Yearlong Course Outcomes: As a result of this course, students will be able to:  "
"● Analyze the various political, geological, economic, and social factors that help shape Portland. (Inquiry and Critical Think ing; "
"Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice)  "
"● Examine various factors that lead to both a “sense of place” and to displacement. (Inquiry and Critical Thinking; Diversity, "
"Equity, and Social Justice; Ethics, Agency, and Community)  "
2 
"● Recognize the importance of equity as we explore Portland as a city , and the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to "
"investigating the city.( Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice; Ethics, Agency, and Community)  ● Develop inquiry and critical thinking skills that help us address important social issues. (Inquiry and Critical Thinking; Et hics, "
"Agency, and Community)  "
"● Use evidence as a means to deepen understanding of an issue, solve problems, discover new ideas, develop perspective on a "
"topic, and/or effectively convey a point of view to others. (Inquiry and Critical Thinking; Communication) ● Develop skills of "
"observa tion, civic engagement, dialogue, and analysis; practice being a deep listener. (Inquiry and Critical Thinking; "
"Communication; Ethics, Agency, and Community )  "
"● Make use of the writing process, including brainstorming, drafting, workshopping, revising, edi ting, and proofreading work. "
(Communication)  
"● Find, evaluate, synthesize, and analyze a variety of primary and secondary sources, and use appropriate means of "
documentation for those sources. (Communication)  
"● Synthesize materials, developing your own perspective as you integrate your own ideas and experiences with those of others. "
"(Inquiry and Critical Thinking; Communication; Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice; Ethics, Agency, and Community ) "
Required Course Materials  
● Course materials will be made available through Canvas. We will look at PDFs of several chapters from David Banis 
"and Hunter Shobe’s book titled Portlandess: A Cultural Atlas (Seattle: Sasquatch Books, 2015). If you want to buy  the "
"book for yourself instead of reading the chapters as PDFs, it’s easy to find used copies in good condition.  "
● We will make use of free text resources to support you with your writing. These will be made available through links in 
Canvas.  
"You are responsible for reading closely, thoroughly, and critically. Make sure to have resources such as a dictionary and/or "
"the internet on hand so that you can look up words, terms, or places that are unfamiliar to you.  "
"Also, set up a plan to:  "
● Keep track of notes and organize them in a way that you can find them  
● Keep track of course materials and the course schedule  
● Devote specific time to working on this course  
Class meeting Times and Schedule: This course is set up as a face -to-face course and includes both a class session with the professor 
(Dr. Annie Knepler) and a mentor session once a week with Clover Javurek -Humig. Our hope is to build an engaged and supportive 
"classroom community. It is es sential that you attend class, and attendance is expected unless you are feeling sick or encounter "
unforeseen circumstances that keep you from coming to class.  
3 
"Canvas and PebblePad: In order to enhance your learning this term, we will continue to make use of two online learning platforms. "
"The course syllabus, class syllabus, assignments, discussion platforms, and additional resources will be made available on -line through Canvas  and you will use  PebblePad  to help you reflect on, collect, and display your work.  "
Mentor Sessions and FYE: Your mentor and your mentor sessions are an essential part of your FRINQ experience. Mentor sessions 
"provide you with the opportunity to discuss ideas, generate questions, and participate in small -group activities that will enhance your "
learning. The profe ssor and the mentor have worked hard to coordinate lesson plans and activities. Clover can also point you to 
various resources and provide you with tools to help you navigate your world here at PSU. This section of FRINQ is part of th e First 
Year Experienc e (FYE) program at Portland State.  
My Teaching Philosophy: My approach to teaching grows out of my own passion for learning and discovery. My research and 
"writing have always been interdisciplinary, meaning that my work draws from various fields of study.  As a teacher, I hope to "
"encourage you to explore new ideas and discover different approaches. I believe that we are continually learning, both within  and "
"outside the classroom, and that we learn from both our successes and our failures. Our learning shoul d help us tackle important social "
"and ethical questions, as well as provide tools to help us make positive change.  "

"*Participation: This course emphasizes ongoing and consistent engagement, and at the end of the term you will once again assess "
"your own participation. For this course, participation includes: attendance at main and mentor sessions and active engagement  in those "
classes; showing up for one -on-one conferences; seeking out additional support when needed; supporting your peers through 
"providing solid feedback, encouragement, and ideas; participating in activities related to this course; assessing your own pa rticipation. "
This course assumes that you can “show up” in many ways. I also want to stress the importance of communication. If you are having 
"problems with technology, are confused by a task, or simply facing challenges getting your work done, be sure to reach out.  "
4 
Some Guidelines for class Participation and Discussion:  
● Encourage an environment of respect where differing points of view and experiences are recognized. ● Allow room for 
"and encourage others to speak, and raise your hand when you want to speak so that the class has time to recognize who wants to speak.  "
● Cell phones and computers can prevent us from being fully present in a conversation. Make sure that you use technology only 
"when it directly relates to the class or an activity, and put your screens down when we are having a class discussion unless you "
need to make a direct reference to a reading or notes.  
● Embrace active listening as essential to creating a good dialogue.  
"Planning Your Time: In college classes, you spend less time “in class” and more time working "
"on your own. This can be an adjustment for many people, and involves careful planning. For "
"each class credit hour taken,  you should plan to spend 2 -3 hours per week studying or outside "
"of class. Since this is a 5 credit course, you should plan to spend 10 -15 hours a week outside "
"of class time working on readings, assignments, etc. Academic Advising  offers further tips on "
"managing your schedule. Keep a calendar, and get in the habit of marking not just “due dates” but "
also blocking off time when you will work on projects.

Brief Assignment Descriptions  
Below are brief descriptions of the assignments for this class; I will provide more detailed descriptions as we move through them. Our 
hope is that you continue to work on developing good habits when it comes to actively reading your assignments: we will g o through 
"each assignment in class, but it is your responsibility to read assignments carefully and ask questions about anything that you "
find confusing or unclear .  
"Learning Journals/Quote, Question, and Response (QQR): To help you respond to and think th rough course materials, you will "
"continue to compose weekly QQRs in a paper journal that I will provide. This is an ongoing assignment . Each week, you will pick a "
"quote or quotes from course readings, develop one question related to all of the readings, an d write a two to three paragraph response.  "
5 
"You can also use your journal to draw out thoughts, map ideas, or even paste in materials that you find. Please be sure to date or "
"write the week for all of your weekly journal entries, and to bring your paper journal to every class. Here are the details for a QQR:  "
"Quote: Pick a significant passage (1 -3 sentences) from each of the readings that raises questions, brings up ideas, or connects "
"to other id eas. Write out the passage(s) in your Learning Journal. If there is more than one reading, you should pick a passage "
from each (hopefully you can connect the two passages).  
Question: Come up with a question that you want to discuss based on your understanding of the readings. Though you may 
"have factual questions, and you should note those, think of this question as one that could lead to an interesting discussion . We "
"will discuss what  makes a good question. You only need to come up with one question per week, even if there is more than one "
reading or video.  
Response: You should respond to the reading(s) in a way that is both meaningful to you and helps you connect the topic to 
other i deas or experiences you’ve encountered. You might start your response by thinking through the meaning of the quote(s) 
that you picked. Why did these ideas stand out to you? What can they tell us about the broader topic/issue? Your response 
"should be two to  three full paragraphs, but you only need one response per week even if there is more than one reading.  "
Exploring Portland: Research Essay: One primary goal for this term is that you develop your academic research skills and learn 
"how to better incorporat e sources. This term, you will develop a research essay on a topic of your choosing so long as it connects to "
"Portland in some way. With help from your instructor, your mentor, and your peers, you will choose and develop a specific top ic "
"and research quest ion, and conduct extensive research on that topic. Before writing the research essay, you will create an annotated "
bibliography to help you assess your research (see below). You will then compose a research essay where you develop a 
"thesis/perspective on y our topic, convey your knowledge of the topic, and help others understand the significance of your topic and "
perspective.  
Annotated Bibliography : An annotated bibliography is an important part of the research process. It is a way to document your 
"research, and discover how and why you will use the sources that you end up citing. As a first step towards creating your res earch "
"essay, you will develo p an annotated bibliography that both describes the key elements of several of the sources you have found and "
explains how you will apply the source to your work.  
Map: You will create your own map that connects to your research topic and thesis. The map m ay highlight specific places that 
"“speak” to your topic, or it may be a creative interpretation of your topic. In addition to the maps in your Portlandness text, we will "
look at other maps that convey and interpret ideas and information.  
6 
"DIY Project: Portland is known for its do -it-yourself (DIY) culture. In the spirit of DIY, you will identify a skill you want to learn and "
"practice. You will commit to devoting at least one hour each week to this project throughout the term.  ePortfolio: You will conti nue to work on your ePortfolio. For winter term, you will revise the work you did on the ePortfolio in the "
"fall, examine other UNST goals, and reflect on your experience this term. You will also start using PebblePad to organize/des ign your "
portfolio mater ials.  
Class Policies and Expectations  
Attendance: Attendance in both main and mentor sessions remains an essential part of this course as we try to stay connected and learn fr om 
"each other. The expectation is that, so long as you are able, you should be present in class and ready to participate. We wil l take attendance, "
and attendance is a key factor of your class participation grade. More than four absences during the quarter from either a main session or a 
"mentor session may result in a lower grade. Missing more than 6 classes is grounds for not passing the course. This being said, please do "
"not come to class when you are sick (we will discuss this further). In regards to attendance, communication is key. If you are having trouble "
"being present for any reason (connectivity, access, illness, or other circu mstances) it is important that you communicate with me and the "
mentor.  
"Late Assignments : If you do not communicate with me about an extension on an assignment, I reserve the right to lower a grade if an "
"assignment is late. These are complex times and I un derstand that things may come up that interrupt your workflow. At the same time, I will "
"also be juggling a complex schedule, and your classmates will also rely on you for peer reviews, discussions, and support. I ask that you do "
"all that you can to complet e your work on time. The key here is communication . Let us know if you are struggling to keep up, confused "
"about your role, or just need some general support to get things done.  "
"Format for assignments : Formats for assignments this term will vary, but most  written assignments should be typed using a standard 12 -"
"point font (such as Cambria or Times New Roman). Use MLA style citation form when appropriate. Your name, the course name and  number, "
"the instructor’s name, and the date should appear in the upper le ft corner of all material.  "
"Preparing for Class: Your goal is come to class prepared to participate in class activities, and ready to discuss the readings and other "
"materials assigned for that week. I recognize that there are many challenges and distractions this year, but being as prepare d as you can be  will "
help you learn and succeed.  
"Writing and Critical Reading: We think of writing and reading as means of communication, but both do more than simply convey ideas. "
"Writing and reading help us think. Through reading other people’s work and respectfully a ttempting to understand their perspective, we "
"broaden our own understanding of issues and expand our capacity to understand complex ideas. Through writing, we pull togethe r our own "
"thoughts, organize our ideas, and come to a better understanding of how we view the world around us.  "
7 
"E-mail policy : I check my work email regularly during the week and try to respond in a timely fashion. However, please keep in mind the "
following:  
"● Please state your question or comment as clearly as possible. Before sending an email, please make sure you have explored oth er "
"avenues for answering questions. For example, look to the syllabus/assignment before asking about due dates or readings. ● Remem ber that email may not be an appropriate form of communication for all types of questions and issues. In some cases, I may as k "
or require that we set up a time to talk in person or over Zoom.  
"● I will try to respond to emails within a 24 -hour period, but I may not get to an email sent during the day or evening until the next "
"day. I also will not be checking work email on weekends. Please plan accordingly. For example, read assignments well in "
advance so you have time to ask questions and receive a response .  
Title IX Reporting Obligations and Creating a Safe Campus Environment: Title IX is a federal law that requires the university to 
"appropriately respond to any concerns of sex/gender discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence. To assure students receive "
"support, faculty members are required to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual violence and/or other forms of prohibited "
discrimination to PSU’s Title IX Coordinator. If you would rather share information about these experiences with an employee who 
"does not have these reporting responsibilities and can keep  the information confidential, please contact one of the following campus "
resources at this link: https://www.pdx.edu/sexual -assault/get -help  
"Conduct and technology: As a student at PSU, it is your responsibility to read and understand the Student Conduct  Code "
(https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -student -code -conduct ). The conduct code details your rights and responsibilities as a 
student and as a member of Portland State Community.  
Plagiarism: University policy calls for severe sanctions for any fo rm of academic dishonesty. All ideas and quotations that are not your 
own must be cited; otherwise it is plagiarism. Work that is plagiarized will receive a failing grade. Plagiarism is relativel y easy to do. It 
"is also, however, quite easy to catch. We wi ll discuss plagiarism and how to avoid it in this class, but for more information on what "
"constitutes plagiarism, refer to the Writing Center. For more information on the consequences of plagiarism, see the student code of "
conduct: https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -student -code -conduct#AcademicDishonesty

In this course, we will use the city of Portland to uncover how the place we live in shapes our lives, and how we, in turn, shape the places. We will examine the city as a context for human development and cultural expression; as an urban area of diverse communities; as part of the larger natural, material, and social environment of the Pacific Northwest; as a political, economic, and cultural entity within the United States of America; and as a site of global capitalist production. We will discuss what connects us to our place(s) as well as what makes place(s) part of our social, cultural, spiritual, economic and political life.  We will read broadly, touching on multiple disciplines and perspectives. We will use the city as our laboratory as we explore the communities and spaces of greater Portland.  Course Outcomes/Learning Objectives The Four University Studies Learning Goals:  University Studies courses focus on four main learning goals.  Throughout this course, you will develop your skills in these areas:  "
Figure 1 Parody Movie Poster by David Walker  
"Page 2 of 7 Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways—writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies. Critical Thinking and Inquiry: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula—problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners. Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives. Ethics, Agency and Community: Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities. UNST Mission: Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry-based pedagogy: • provokes students to build self-efficacy through relational learning across difference • encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for transformative learning • advances civic engagement, reflective practice, and the scholarship of teaching and learning UNST Vision: Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously in imagining and co-creating a just world. Technology Recording Technology Notice We may use appropriate technologies for taking notes in this course. Our use of such technology is governed by FERPA, the Acceptable Use Policy and PSU’s Student Code of Conduct. We will not share recordings of class activities nor contents of our Google Drive outside of course participants, which include your fellow students, TAs/GAs/Mentors, and any guest faculty or community-based learning partners that we may engage with. You may not share recordings outside this course. Doing so may result in disciplinary action.   Major Assignments Attendance -  DUE Daily  Participation – DUE Daily   "

You will find everything you need in our Class Drive… daily class documents, readings, resources, etc. Each of you will have your own turn-in folder where you will, as the name suggests, turn in all your work. This material is not to be shared outside of our class community. Talk to me if you have any questions or concerns about use of the Drive.  Grading Criteria I have structured the course in an intentional fashion in order to create a vibrant and supportive learning community and foster student agency in claiming your education. Students will be deeply involved in assessing their performance and learning over the course of the term and selecting their grade. Course assignments will encourage a reflective learning practice that facilitates a deeper processing of course concepts and which encourages connection to real world issues. This structure is reflective of a commitment to the values of democracy, horizontalism in the classroom, decentralization, interdisciplinarity, and a rich form of participation, which I hope will provide for a dynamic learning experience. In line with the aim of taking agency over your education you will determine your own grade at the end of term, with input from the mentor and I. Along the way, I’ll offer you qualitative feedback on your assignments and at the end of the term, you will write a reflection on your work that assesses your own performance during the term and documents your growth on the 4 UNST goals.  I am much more interested in your learning than in the grade I enter for you at the end of the term. By remaining in this course, you agree to the conditions set forth here, including the course requirements and the terms for self-assessment outlined above.   "

"
"Page 5 of 7 • Everyone starts the term with 4 attendance points. Each main class and each mentor session you miss costs 1 point. • 3 points translates to 10% of officially scheduled classtime. • If you are sick, you should stay home! That’s what the points are for. • Don’t squander your points on unnecessary absences. • Other conditions requiring longer absence require an individual agreement to modify this policy. • If you miss more than a third of a main or mentor session by being tardy or leaving early you forfeit .5 point. • If you have zero points at the end, attendance points will not affect your grade. • Your grade will be affected, positively or negatively, if you have more or less than zero attendance points. • Consult the daily agenda and make arrangements to get notes and materials from a classmate and when you must miss class.  PSU Policies and Resources Academics Academic Integrity Academic integrity is a vital part of the educational experience at PSU. The Student Code of Conduct is the university’s policy on academic dishonesty. A confirmed violation of that code in this course may result in failure of the course. Incomplete Grades Policy Students do not have a right to receive or demand an Incomplete grade. The option of assigning an Incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor when these criteria are met: • Required satisfactory course completion/participation • Reasonable justification for the request • Not sought as a substitute for a poor grade • Presence of a written agreement (such as the Incomplete Contract) • A plan in place to resolve Incomplete status The Office of the Registrar’s website has the full Incomplete Grades policy.  Student Services Disability Access Statement If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact the Disability Resource Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable accommodations.

"B = Work is good, a few areas to improve.  "
C = Work meets minimum assignment requirements but rarely exceeds them.  
D = Work shows effort but does not meet assignment requirements in some way(s).   3 
"F = Work is not handed in, is very minimal, and/or is far off -assignment.  "
Online Course Format:  
This is a 100% asynchronous online course. “Asynchronous” means we will not meet together at 
"a certain time. Our course is located on Canvas, which you can access using your ODIN login. You "
can find a link to Canvas as well as other useful student resources on PSU’s  I Am a Student  page. 
"Once you log in to Canvas, you should see our course among your courses.  "
"Throughout the week, you will manage your own schedule, but there will be weekly due dates "
"(see “Late Work” below). Because we will interact online, it’s important to do your  discussion "
"posts on time, so we can communicate  and build  community. Though we have no required "
"meetings, I am happy meet with you by Zoom by appointment.  "
Discussion Forums /Participation  Policies : 
"Since this is an online asynchronous class, it is vital that everyone participate fully and promptly "
"on our course site. One of the goals of University Studies is “communication,” and this term we’ll "
communicate  largely through Canvas forums. Discussion and other weekly participation 
assignments  are graded on a  complete/incomplete basis with deductions for lateness as follows:  
All parts are completed and on time:    100%  
All parts are completed but some or  
all are up to  one (1) week late:    90%  
All parts are completed but some or  
all are more than  one (1) we ek late:    80% 
The assignment is not submitted  or  
not all parts are  completed by the final due date:  0% 
There will be two final due dates during the term:  
"• For work from Weeks 1 -5: final due date is Friday  of Week 6 (February 16, 2024 ) "
"• For work from Weeks 6 -10: final due date is Friday  of Week 11  (March 22, 2024 ). "
"You may drop one forum of your choice from your grade totals. In other words, it will not count "
"toward your final grade. Contact me to tell me which forum, if any, you wish to drop.  "
"Canva s due dates : Canvas can only list one due date per forum, so it cannot remind you of both "
due dates for initial posts and replies. Ashley’s and my past experience shows  that setting the 
"due date for the initial posts is more helpful for students, but that means you must remember "
replies !

"We will develop class norms as guidelines for having excellent, productive conversations. In "
"broad terms, be respectful and support ea ch other’s learning. Remember, there is a real person "
"behind the screen. In the unlikely event that a student is significantly disruptive, they may be "
reported to the Office of the Dean of Student Life.  
Late Work Policy for Major Assignments  
"For our four  major assignments (i.e. not discussion/participation), the late work policy is as "
follows:  
Assignment is up to one (1) week late:    -10%  
Assignment is more than one (1) week late:   -20%  
"Work will be accepted for late credit up to Friday  of Week 1 0. At my discretion, I may give a small "
"extension  beyond this  for the final major assignment , including the Final Reflection . "
Extensions on Work:  
"If you need an extension of up to a few days on an assignment, message me to explain what "
additional time you need at least 24 hours before the assignment is due . We will then agree 
"on a new due date. If the work is not submitted by the date we agree on, l ate penalties will "
be assessed based on the extended  due date. This policy is designed to encourage personal 
agency and responsibility in managing workload and due dates.  
Homework Format:  
"Major assignments must be typed, double -spaced using an 11 or 12 -point font, plain face (not "
"bold ), with one -inch margins, unless otherwise specified . "
No Heading Penalty:   
You must put your name on all your work . This is an expectation in most professiona l writing 
"and is good to practice. A heading  usually states your name, professor's name, class, and date "
"at the top of your paper. To avoid the no heading penalty, you must minimally write your "
name.  NO HEADING PENALTY:  You will lose 0.5 points if a submit ted written assignment does 
"not include a HEADING. Exceptions: discussion forum posts, quizzes, and surveys do not need a "
heading.  
Vocabulary: Heading vs. Header : A “heading” includes your name and other identifying 
"information, usually 1 inch down from the top of the page. A “header” is the area in the top "
1/2 inch of your pages where page numbers go (and sometimes you name as well).  
Revision Policy:  
Revising wor k is vital to a successful writing process. It is expected that you will revise work on 
"your own prior to submission. However, you may further revise and resubmit any final  5 "
"assignment one time  to improve your grade, except the E-Portfolio and Final Reflection , the final "
assignment of the term . Any late work deductions already assessed will remain. If you wish to 
"revise an assignment, please contact me to discuss your situation. Revisions are due by Friday  of "
Week 10 .  
Content Statement:  
It is nature  of critical inquiry  courses like this one to discuss complex and controversial topics 
"that may make us uncomfortable. In fact, such discomfort is often a sign of productive critical "
thinking and reasoned inquiry into socially important issues. I encourage  you to embrace this 
"discomfort as a part of active learning. In some cases, however, a class member may have "
personal associations with a topic that make the topic distressing in a way that interferes with 
"learning. In such a case, that class member is en couraged to consult with the professor.  "
Withdrawal from the Course:  
"If you need to drop/withdraw from this course, please consult PSU’s Withdrawal, Cancellation, "
and Drops  page. Note that successful completion of UNST 11 8 is a prerequisite to UNST 11 9. If 
"you do not complete UNST 11 8, you may repeat the entire year -long course next year or take a "
different FRINQ if one is available.  
Equity and Compliance Statement:  
We commit to equity as a foundation of PSU’s excellence. We define equity as ensuring 
"everyone has access to opportunities necessary to satisfy essential needs, advance their well -"
"being, and achieve their full potential. Our aim is to address the roots of inequities , including but "
"not limited to racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, classism, and the intersections of these "
inequities ( Let Knowledge Serve the Cit y: Strategic Plan 2016 -2020 ). 
"In particular, discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, disability, national origin, race, "
"color, marital status, veteran status, religion, sex, sexual orientation, genetic information or in "
"the use of Worker's Compe nsation, Federal Family Medical Leave Act, or the Oregon Medical "
Leave Act is strictly prohibited by  PSU Prohibited Discrimination & Harassment Policy  and is 
unlawful.  
Access and Inclusion for Students with Disabilities  
"PSU values diversity and inclusion; My goal is to create a learning environment that is accessible, "
"equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. I am committed to fostering mutual respect and full "
participation for all students. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to 
"your inclusion or learning, please notify me. Additionally, the Disability Resource Center (DRC) "
provides reasonable accommodations for students who encounter barriers i n the learning 
"environment. The DRC works with students who have physical, learning, cognitive, mental "
"health, sensory, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may "
"affect your work in this class and feel you need accom modations, contact the Disability Resource "
Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable 
"accommodations. If you already have accommodations, please contact me to make sure that I  6 "
have received your faculty notification lett er from the DRC so we can discuss your 
accommodations. You can contact the DRC at 503 -725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu or visit the DRC 
online at https://www.pdx.edu/disability -resource -center .  
Religious Observance Policy  
"While PSU does not observe most religious holidays, the university is committed to "
"accommodating any students who have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments, or other "
"required attendance due to religious obligations, provided adequate notice is given . If your "
"religious observances will cause you to miss a deadline at any point in this term, please reach out "
to me no later than October 1 so that we can establish accommodations for your absence.  
School / Life Conflict Policy  
"To master the course mate rial and succeed in this class, it will be important for students to keep "
"up with course material class and complete all course assignments in full and on time. However, I "
recognize that many students face obstacles to their education as a result of work o r family 
obligations or unforeseen personal difficulties. If at any point you are experiencing challenges 
"that are impacting your ability to succeed in this course, please reach out to me immediately so "
that we can work together to form a plan for your aca demic success.

Policy on Academic Honesty  
Academic honesty is a cornerstone of any meaningful education and a reflection of each  7 
"student's maturity and integrity. The Code of Student Conduct and Responsibility, which appli es "
"to all students, prohibits all forms of academic cheating, fraud, and dishonesty. These acts "
"include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, buying and selling of course assignments and research "

PSU Code of Conduct on Using AI:  
"“At PSU, the expectation under our Code is that work students submit is their own original work, "
completed wit hout the use of unauthorized materials and tools. This is stated in section 9 of the 
"Code, ‘Unless otherwise specified by the faculty member, all submissions, whether in draft or "
"final form, must either be the Student’s own work, or must clearly acknowledg e the source(s). ’ "
"While the code doesn't explicitly prohibit AI technology, it does prohibit cheating, the use of "
"unauthorized materials in the general sense, which would include tools like AI generators, and "
"plagiarism, which is using content without citi ng appropriate sources. ” "

__________________________________________________________________________  
“I think calling it climate change is rather limiting. I would rather call it the everything change.”  
"Margaret Atwood, Author  "
"“Intergenerational solidarity is not optional, but rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received "
also belongs to those who will follow us. ” 
Pope Francis  
"“What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.”  "
"Dr Jane Goodall, Scientist & Activist  "
Course Descripti on Many  consider climate change to be the pressing sustainability problem  facing our 
planet. Climate is the stage upon which all human and non -human life depend. Alter this stage and the “play” 
as we know it will change. Sustainability requires understanding how our actions impact  this stage both for 
"the present  and future generations. During this term we will learn the basic science of climate change, "
"analyze our contribution to climate change , and evaluate  means to reduce carbon emissions . We will consider  "
"the ethics of climate change, debate strategies to limit warming, and learn about  complex climate imp acts "
"that are already creating climate refugees .  At the end of this term, students will develop a greater "
appreciation for the challenges and opportunities of climate change.  
Learning objectives  
• Develop understanding of the basic science of climate change  
• Appreciate potential impacts of climate change  
• Evaluate options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions  
• Increase quantitative and information  literacy  skills  
"• Consider questions of personal, national and global responsibility with regards to climate  "
• Improve group communication skills through team project s  
• Appreciate the interconnections between climate change and ethics  
• Increase ability to communicate your ideas with audience through writing  
• Increase oral communication and critical thinking skills  
Freshman Inquiry  
2 
 Freshma n Inquiry is part of the first -year experience for students entering PSU. Built around a theme of 
"inquiry, over the course of a year, each FRINQ provides students a place to examine challenging course "
topics through a variety of perspectives while gaining knowledge and skills they will need in their other 
"courses and career.  FRINQ  consists  of a main session led by your faculty instructor , and smaller  mentor "
session s led by your peer mentor  that immediately follow. If you do not know which mentor session you are 
"registered for, let us know, and we will get you straightened out!  "
University Studies  
"As part of the University Studies program, this course is intended to help you develop the skills you will "
need to thrive at the university level and in your professional life beyond the university. To help you succeed 
"in this regard, the program has four central goals:  "
Inquiry & Critical Thinking : Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary 
"curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self-motivated, and "
empowered learners.  
"Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, graphics, "
"numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be "
competent in appropriate communication technologies.  
"Diversity, Equity & Social Justice : Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and "
social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives . 
"Ethic s, Agency  & Community : Students will examine values, theories, and practices that inform their "
"actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities . "
"By working towards these goals within the context of “ Sustainability ” you will acquire the writing, research, "
and critical skills you will need to do well in your major; be exposed to a wide range of academic fields so 
that you will gain a better sense of where your intellectual passions lie; obtain practical and technical  abilities 
pertinent to future job success; and take a significant first step on the path to becoming a well -educated 
person.  
Course policies  
Mentor Session Your mentor session is led b y Dom onique Brock -Chatto . Mentor sessions are opportunities 
"to learn skills, build community, connect with campus resources, and participate in activities that support "
class assignments. Participation in mentor sessions also counts towards your participation grade.   
Class Schedul e It is your responsibility to keep track of the due dates for all homework and reading 
"assignments. Our class will stay as close to the schedule as possible; however, due to the fact that each class "
"moves at its own pace, the due dates of assignments and r eadings will occasionally change. I will "
"communicate all changes during class  and on Canvas , but it is your responsibility to double -check your "
knowledge of due dates in case you missed any announced changes or were absent when one was made.  
"Readings Most readings will be posted to Canvas. Readings come from a mix of sources, including "
"government reports, academic journals and non -profit organizations. Some of the readings are difficult and "
use terminology that will likely be unfamiliar with. That’s ok ay. Others may contain simple language but 
"have challenging ideas. I recommend reading the articles in a quiet space. Keep a reading journal, take notes, "
"write down questions and your responses, and bring these to class. Be an active reader! You w ill need to "
"have access to readings in class, and I recommend viewing the articles on your laptop with its larger display "
rather than your phone.  
"Class Structure  Most main sessions will consist of mini -lectures, class discussions, and small group "
"activities. These a ctivities often will require use of the Internet so bring a  web-enabled device , preferably a "
"laptop , to class.  Dom onique  and I  will pop into groups  to participate in group discussions  and answer  "
3 
" questions.   At the end of breakout sessions, we reconvene as a whole class and groups report back what they "
discussed in small groups.  
Attendance is required in both main and mentor sessions.  You earn participation grade (see below) through 
your attendance AND active participation in both classes. Participation includes individual contributions to 
class discussions and active participation in group activities. Please consider how your use of technology 
affects those around you. Use of technology and media devices unrelated to class activities is distracting to 
"your instructors and other students, and will count against your participation grade unless explicitly excused.  "
Email  I welcome your email at cbuten@pdx.edu . Don’t hesitate to email me with any questions or concerns 
you have about the class or assignments. Some students are bashful about emailing because they are unsure 
"how to address me, so let me offer some suggestions, “Good morning [afternoon, evening] Dr. Butenhoff ,”,  "
"“Dear Chris, ”, “Hello Prof. B, “. Avoid “hey there”, “ hi dude”  and “what’s up”       . Please start subject line "
with ‘FRINQ: ‘. Sign with your first name and last name (at least at the beginning of the term) . No need to 
include your PSU ID. Make sure to use your PSU email account and check it regularly. I encourage you to 
send me an email at least once in the first two weeks of the term just to op en the lines of communication. If 
"you like, you can tell me how the first week or two of the term is going.  "
Submission of work You will submit most of your graded work to our Canvas  course website . The 
timestamp on your uploaded file must be before the deadline . I will add my feedback and grade your 
"submission on Canvas , so be sure to return to your submission after it is graded to read my comments and "
"feedback. All files must be submitted in PDF format . If you do not know how to convert your file to PDF, "
please ask.  
Turnitin   Your assignment is automatically submitted to the plagiarism -detecting software Turnitin  which 
produces a “Similarity Score” for your work. This score is the percentage of your work that is unoriginal or 
identical  to the work of other authors searched by the software. Since some quotations and references will be 
"similar to other work for legitimate reasons, even non -plagiarized work will have a similarity score greater  "
"than 0%, but as  a rule of thumb your score should be no more  than 15%. You can check your similarity score "
before assignment deadlines  and revise  if needed.  
Late work  turned in more than 1 h our past the deadline is late  unless ok ayed by me in advance . Most 
assignments are due at 11:59pm  on the day of the deadline. Late work accrues a n immediate  5% deduction 
then an additional 5% deduction for each day late ( as counted 24 hours past the original due date) . For 
"example, a late assignment turned in within 1 day of deadline receives a 5% deduction, between 1 -2 days "
"late, 10%, 2 -3 days late, 15% deduction, etc.  Contact  me in advance if you think you will need an "
extension.    
Written Work   
"• Unless instructed otherwise, type all of your written work  and submit as a PDF.    "
• Double space and use one-inch margins (72 pt) all around.  
• Use a 12 -point Times -Roman font.  
"• In the upper right -hand corner, include your name, course (i.e UNST 124A), name of assignment and "
date 
• Most assignments require a title that is different than the name of the assignment  
"• Always use correct sentence and paragraph structure, punctuation, and spelling.  "
• We will use APA style throughout the year. All citations and end references must be formatted according 
"to APA style. An excellent APA style reference is Purdue University’s Online Writing Lab (OWL), "
http://owl.english.purdue.edu  
• You do not need a separate title or cover page as some APA guides recommend   
• Include a complete list of properly formatted references where appropriate   
4 
" • Include word count at end.  In MS Word, you can find word count under the Review menu.  In Google "
Docs word count is in the Tools menu.  
Plagiarism  We expect that the writing you do for this course will be your own work. You violate this ethic if 
"you copy materials without acknowledging the source, present a slightly rearranged wording of source "
"materials as your own, or submit a copy of a paper iden tical to that submitted by another student. Plagiarism "
will result in a zero grade for the assignment and possibly lead to more severe academic consequences.  
Generative AI  
We are entering a new age with generative AI tools like ChatGPT and we are only beginning to understand 
"how these tools can be used effectively in the classroom. Clear guidelines will be provided regarding when, "
"where, and how these tools may be utilized along with instructions for proper attribution. To uphold "
"scholarly standards, students are required to cite any AI -generated material that contributes to their work, "
"including in -text citations, quotations, and references. The generation of content through AI without "
appropriate attribution constitutes academic misconduct.  
Classroom conduct : We live in a polarized political climate  and matters related to sustainability often bring 
"political divisions to light.  We hope to have spirited conversations and discussions this year, some of which "
may contain ideas and beliefs that vary significantly from your own . We would like to have a classroom that 
is based on mutual respect.   It is important to remember that students in this class come from diverse 
backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of perspectives. It is not necessar y that you agree with other s’ 
"opinions, only that you listen to and engage them with utmost respect. To this end, we will not tolerate "
"disruptions, rudeness, or personal attacks (which should not be confused with serious and meaningful debate "
"and discussion).  Additionally, I will expe ct you to conduct yourself appropriately, which means acting in the "
same manner you would in any professional environment.  
"PSU Code of Student Conduct and Responsibility: As with all other classes at PSU, conduct  "
questions not explicitly covered by this syllabus are covered by PSU’s Code. You may find this  
document at:  https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/psu -student -code -conduct  
Campus resources  
The CAR E program  connects students with resources when they are experiencing distress and/or other issues 
that might impact their ability to function at their best in and outside of the classroom  such as mental health 
"and medical challenges, and food and housing insecurity. CARE personnel meet  with students one -on-one to "
"hear about their academic barriers, and to collaborate on a plan to address these barriers in an effort to ease "
the stress of navigating multiple systems . You can learn more about CARE and schedule an appointment at 
https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/care -program  
"COVID -19 Resources  Portland State has been working diligently to address the health, safety, and well -"
being needs of the entire PSU community during the COVID -19 pandemic. Every effort is being made to 
"provide an accurate and efficient flow of communication to all students, staff, and faculty. As questions and "
"concerns arise, a multitude of campus resources are available to you. If you are ever unsure how to find a "
resource explore the Coronavirus Response page at https://www.pdx.edu/coronavirus -response . Help is near. 
Reach out.  
The Basic Needs Hub  provides students with one place to stop for all concerns related to providing for basic 
"needs support , including food, housing and financial services.  Their mission is to connect PSU students to "
"resources in the moment of need so students can focus on academics, career goals, and interpersonal "
relationships . Find it at https://www.pdx.edu/dean -student -life/basic -needs -hub.

" Disability Resources : If you have a disability and require assistance obtaining resources at PSU, please see "
me. We will be happy to accommodate you as best we can. You can visit the Disability Resource Center  at 
https://www.pdx.edu/disability -resource -center/  for more information.  
"Safe Campus If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate  "
resources at Sexual Misconduct Prevention & Response:  www.pdx.edu/sexual -assault/ . PSU's Student Code 
of Conduct makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are strictly prohibited and 
"offenses are subject to the full realm of sanctions, up to and including suspension and expulsion.  "
"Finally,  we are here because we want you to succeed. Please ask for help when you need it. If you are having "
"problems with the course, time management, or with your freshman (or other) year in general, please discuss "
it with me or your mentor so that we ca n help you address the issue.  
Assignments & Grading  
Your grade is based on completion of these course components. The weight of each component towards your 
final course grade is given in parentheses.  
Participation ( 13%) Attendance is required in both main and mentor sessions. You earn participation grade 
through attendance and active participation in both classes. Participation includes contributions to class 
discussions and participation in group activities. Use of techn ology and media devices unrelated to class 
activities will count against your participation grade unless explicitly excused. You can miss 3 class 
"meetings  before absences will affect your grade (this includes main and mentor sessions, i.e., one day of "
main and mentor session counts as two class meetings).  You are tardy if you arrive to class 2 -10 minutes  
"late, and your attendance is reduced by one class period for every 3 times you are tardy . If you are "
"between 10 -60 minutes, attendance for that class period is cut in half. You will not receive any attendance "

"true/false and short answer questions testing basic understanding of the day’s readings. In some cases, I will "
ask you to submit questions for class discussion. One quiz question will typically inquire into any di fficulties 
you had with the reading so we can discuss in class.  Quizzes will be available at least two class periods in 
"advance and I will drop your three lowest quizzes at the end of term. Note, while MC and T/F questions are "
"graded automatically and imm ediately in Canvas, I grade short answer questions manually so don’t panic if a "

Course  Description  
"This course explores the interconnectedness of global social, economic, and environmental "
systems  and our impact on the world we share with all living beings. Last term we explored 
"how our cultural perspectives shape how we see ourselves in relation to the larger world, "
and how our modern food system has impacted the environment and critical resources.  This 
term we will focus on two key challenges that could destabilize society and critically impede 
our ability to build a sustainable future: 1) the prolifer ation of disinformation  and a growing 
distrust of institutions and of science; and 2) climate change. We will delve into  the benefits 
"and risks of social media  and AI, and how these are alter ing societ y and helping to spread "
disinformation . We will talk about the scientific method and how science is  mis-interpreted 
by and mis-represented  to the public . We will explore  the fundamentals of climate change 
and the threats  it poses. And we  will look beyond the problems themselves and think how 
we can craft solutions for reducing vulnerability and building resilience.  
Required Texts  
You do not need to buy a text for this term’s class. We will utilize various sources for 
readings this term. These will be posted on CANVAS along with the schedule for readings  
(see the back of this syllabus) . Here is a link to a webpage  to help you navigate CANVAS .

Course Policies and Expectations  
Classroom Environment   
"A healthy classroom – a place of questioning, sharing and learning – requires our "
commitment both as professor and students to care. I am hopeful that we can make our 
shared class space a thoughtful place to help each other process and deal with all that i s 
happening now and to think earnestly about how to shape a more positive future. You may 
"hear statements, opinions, or arguments that differ significantly from your own ideas or that "
make no sense from your point of view. It is important to remember that students come to 
Portland State University from diverse backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of 
perspectives. It is not necessary that you like other people’s opinions or that they like yours. 
It is necessary for you to listen to and engage others with respect.   
You should do your best to come to class having completed assigned readings and ready to 
engage with the material for the day and with everybody else in the room. Engagement 
"requires attention. Please do not distract yourself or others by eating in the cla ssroom, "
"texting, tweeting or otherwise checking your phone or other electronic devices, or by "
"starting to gather your papers, zip up your backpack, or otherwise begin “checking out"" "
before the class is excused.   
Attendance  
"Learning in this class, and most other university classes, requires your attendance and "
participation. You are required to attend both the main class and the mentor section . 
Absences will adversely affect your grade.  
• Missing five main classes and/or mentor sessions will reduce your final grade by a letter 
grade. If you miss more than eight classes and/or mentor sessions you will automatically 
fail the course.   
• Late arrivals are very disruptive to the classroom environment.  Any of us may encounter 
"unexpected issues on any given day that may delay our getting to class on time. However, if you "
"are regularly more than 10 minutes late to class, you will be marked absent.  "
"• Disruptions in the classroom will not be tolerated. If you act disruptive, you will be asked to leave "
the room and marked absent.  
•  If you are forced to miss class for an extended period of time because of exceptional 
"circumstances, make certain to inform me immediately via email  so we may arrange for you "
to make up work.  
Late work   
"Assigned work will typically be collected at the beginning of class on the day that it is due, unless "
otherwise specified on the assignment. Late work turned in by the beginning of the next class 
period following the due date will receive a 20% deduction . Late work will not be 
"accepted  beyond this time, except in cases of compelling, documented emergencies.  It is "
your responsibility to know the due dates and to ensure that your work is turned in on time. 
Make arrangements with one of your peers to obtain no tes and assignments for any days you are 
"absent. If you are going to be absent on an assignment due date, make sure you arrange to get "
the assignment to me BEFORE the start of class.   4  
Written Work Format  
"Unless instructed otherwise, all assignments should follow these formats:    "
• Turn in work as either a Word (*.doc or *.docx) document (preferred) or PDF file  
"• Include a header with your name, class and date in upper left -hand corner of 1st page  "
• Use double -spaced lines and one -inch margins  
• Use a standard serif typeface (such as Times) at 12 point  
• Use page numbers for multi -page documents  
"• Use complete sentences, correct paragraph structure, correct spelling, and correct grammar!  "
• Please include a complete list of properly formatted references  with appropriate citations .  
• Use the APA style for citations and references . You will find examples of this style at the 
"Purdue Online Writing Lab,  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl   "
• Save everything you write in electronic format in two different places . You will return to 
some assignments for ideas and as you build your electronic portfolio.  
Written Work Format   
"Unless instructed otherwise, all assignments should be turned in as WORD documents "
(.docx) or in WORD -compatible format .  
• Please do NOT  use a cover page . A simple header in the upper left -hand corner of 
"the first page with your name, the class &  assignment , and the date will suffice.    "
• DO use a standard serif typeface (such as Times) at 12 point.   
"• You do need to write using complete sentences, correct paragraph structure, correct "
"spelling, and correct grammar . Please edit your work (this is really part of  writing) !  "
• Please include a complete list of properly formatted references with appropriate 
citations.  
• DO use the APA style for citations and references . You will find examples of this style 
"at the Purdue Online Writing Lab,  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl   "
• Save everything you write in electronic format in two different places . You will 
return to some assignments for ideas and as you build your Pebble Pad e -portfolio.  
Academic Integrity   
"Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one's own class and/or course work, being "
"individually accountable, demonstrating intellectual honesty, and abiding by ethical "
standards. Academic integrity is a vital part of the educational experience at PSU. The  Student 
Code of Conduct  is the university’s policy on academic dishonesty. A confirmed violation of 
that code in this course may result in failure.  
Plagiarism  
The writing you do for this course should be your own. You violate this ethic if you copy 
"materials without acknowledging the source, present specific information without "
"acknowledging the source, present a slightly rearranged wording of source materials a s your "
"own, or submit a copy of a paper identical to that submitted by another student. Plagiarism "
will result in a zero grade for the  assignment and possibly lead to more severe 
academic consequences. A second offence will  earn you a failing grade for the  class. If 
"you are uncertain about anything, ask!  5  "
Use of Generative AI  
"You are permitted to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to assist "
you in gathering information and brainstorming ideas but you may not copy and paste 
information directly from the AI tool and present it as your own without ap propriate citation 
and referencing. Doing so is plagiarism.  You are responsible for the information you submit 
based on an AI query and for assuring that it does not contain misinformation or unethical 
content and that it does not violate intellectual prop erty laws. You are expected to include a 
disclosure statement at the end of your assignment describing which AI tool you used and 
"how you used it. For example, ""ChatGPT was used to draft about 30 percent of this paper and "
to provide revision assistance. AI -produced content was edited for accuracy and style.”   
University Resources  
"If you are ever unsure how to find a resource you need or want, here are two “one -stop -"
"shopping”  links to  all the PSU resources, portals, and services you need. You can get help "
"with everything from your classes to your finances. Find a tutor, connect with a cultural "
"center, or talk with a counselor. If you don’t see what you need, just ask .  "

 Course Description:  
" Welcome to winter term! Our adventure together continues, and I am looking forward to seeing where it takes us. This term we will continue with our mindfulness and writing practice – going a bit deeper this time, and really thinking about how these practices can help us tap into our creativity and inner wisdom, how they can help us recognize our flashes of insi ght, how they can "
"help us learn to trust our instincts and intuition, and how they can ultimately empower us to act on the courage of our convictions. In a world that needs healing, we need young people with the vision to imagine a better, more humane worl d and the courage to forge new pathways and create "
a brighter future for themselves and for their children. My hope is that these practices will help plant a seed of inspiration and allow you to imagine what is possible.  
" The goal for this term is to build on the foundation that we created in this classroom last term. Now that we are more comfortable with each other, we want to work towards deepening our level of conversation and engaging more fully with the material at hand. The book that we are going t o read together , along with all the supplemental Ted Talks, podcasts, documentaries , and "
"short readings are going to lead us deeper into some of the topics we brushed upon last term, and introduce us to a host of other topics, as well .  "
" We may b e delving into issues surrounding mental health, grief, shame, race, addiction, poverty, "
"immigration, politics , identity, privilege, climate change, the criminal justice system –  and more. "
"Talking about these issues might lead us into uncomfortable territory and may require us to take some risks with one another. With that in mind, we will spend some time revisiting the guidelines you created to ensure a “brave space” in the classroom, and revising them as suits our needs. We will also intentionally  continue  to work on our discussion skills so that you have the "
tools you need to navigate these potentially uncomfortable conversations.  
" As we continue with our free writing practice, I will be providing you with more tools that will help strengthen your writing skills – both creative and academic. I will also be introducing the "
lyric essay as a form that will help you string together the myriad topics that we  are exploring in 
this class.  
" My hope for this term is that you all continue to show up regularly, to engage deeply with the material , and to invest in the community spirit of the class . I can’t predict where this term will "
"take us, but my intention is to cultivate a shared sense of purpos e, and to get us all thinking about "
what we might want to carry into spring term.  
Course Requirements:  
• A writing utensil and a notebook (one you can tear pages from).  
"• Living Resistance: An Indig enous Vision for Seeking Wholeness Every Day by, Kaitlin B. "
"Curtice. I did not order copies , as you can likely find it for less money than you would if "
you bought it at the PSU bookstore. Please get a copy by the start of Week Three 
(1/23).  
• A NEW folder to store all your written work and all hard copies for this term . I suggest 
"holding onto everything from fall term , as well . You will write an end of year reflection "
"at the end of this course, and may still want to look back at readings/writing from fall "
term.  
• Most readings for this term will be photocopied and distributed in class. They will also be 
uploaded into Canvas .  
 Program Learning Goals:  
 UNST Communication Goal:   Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various 
"ways —writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively "
"with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
UNST Inquiry and Critical Thinking:  Students will learn various  modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become "
"active, self -motivated, and empowered people.  "
"UNST Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice:  Students will explore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple "
perspectives.  
"UNST Ethics, Agency, & Community:  Students will examine values, theories, and practices "
"that inform their actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local "
and global communities.  
Late Work Policy:  
Learning how to manage your time and prioritize your work is an essential skill you need to 
develop in order to become a successful student.  Most of the assignments are designed to 
"prepare you for the class activity or discussion scheduled on the day that your work is due.  So, it "
doesn’t necessarily make sense to do it after the fact.  It is for this reason that I prefer  not to 
accept late work. There may be times when you have missed class and need to make up 
"assignments.  In that case, I may be  willing to  make an exception, but only if you get in touch "
"with me ahead of time to make this arrangement .  So please, make sure to communicate with "
me if you need extra ti me on an assignment.   
Attendance Policy:  
Please come as often as humanly possible.  I know there are challenges.  I know that the 
"transition into college can be an emotionally trying time, and I know that many of us are "
struggling to maintain our mental health. We all have those days when it is a struggle to just get 
"out of bed, but I urge you to push through on those days and come anyway.  You are co- creators "
of this class. Together we can try to bring as much joy and creativity into this learning 
"commun ity as possible; together we can create a space that where you want to show up, but in "
order to do that we need each and every member of this class to be here. This is a very 
"interactive, discussion- based class. It is NOT an on -line class, nor is it a clas s where you sit "
passively and not participate. It’s very important that you keep that in mind.  In order to truly 
"succeed and flourish as part of this learning community, all you really do need to do is show up "
and engage with the material and with each ot her.   
Please do your best to arrive on time. It’s really important for the general flow of the class.  If 
"you arrive late, please enter as quietly and smoothly as possible.   If you know you need to miss class, please email me and Preet to let us know.  If you "
"absolutely must miss class, you are still expected to check Canvas and complete any work "
that you missed.  
Cell Phone Policy:  
"Same as last term, but my hope is that we can all fully commit this time. Let’s have a conversation about this and see where we all stand on this.  "
Grading:  
"In all my years of teaching, my least favorite part of the experience has been the grading.  To be "
"clear, when I say “grading” I do not mean reading, commenting upon, and giving constructive "
feedback to student work.  I enjoy that part of the learning/teac hing process and feel it is 
"essential to fostering student growth.  However, what I do not enjoy, or feel entirely comfortable "
"with, is the part where I have to take a piece of student work and apply a number or a letter grade "
to it using a system of measu rement based upon a pre -determined set of standards and outcomes.  
That very act puts me in a position of power that runs counter to my teaching philosophy and to 
the kind of community I am trying to foster in this classroom.  I am not here to judge you; I  am 
"here to encourage you, to stir up your sense of wonder, and to push you to think deeply, to ask "
"questions, to challenge your beliefs and assumptions, to broaden your perspective and to be open "
to the possibility of transformation.   
I generally begin e ach fall term by reading about and discussing what it means to be an educated 
person and what role a university might play in helping to create such a person. Many of us have 
been socialized to believe that the grade we receive for a course is a true indicator of what we 
"learned, or how we grew, or how well we did in the class.  We’ve been socialized to believe that "
only an outside authority figure or institution can determine the value of our learning.  As a 
"result, we have become passive consumers of our education, believing that our job as students is "
"simply to receive information, prove we understand the information, and then be rewarded (or "
"reprimanded) by an outside authority with a grade, or points, to indicate how well we processed "
this information.  I believe this style of grading feeds into a system of oppression that impacts 
"our learning and our personal growth in negative, and sometimes, damaging ways.   "
"So, in the spirit of seeking alternatives to this system, I will not be giving you a grade for  this "
course.  You will be the person who determines what grade you receive at the end of the term.  I 
will be providing you with feedback and input along the way.  I will also be marking off 
"completed assignments on Canvas, so you can make sure you are ke eping up with the work.  A "
"few weeks into the term, you will also be creating an Individual Course Plan, in which you "
identify your goals for the course and decide upon markers that will help you to achieve these 
"goals (more details regarding this to come – rest assured, you will have guidance).  At the end of "
"the term, I will give each of you an itemized print out of all aspects of your participation in this "
"course, along with a set of prompts that you will address in a written Reflection/ Self -Evaluation, "
"and you will use these as tools to help determine what grade you have earned in this course.  For some of you this may feel like a daunting task.  With that in mind, let me be clear about what "
"I believe full involvement in this course looks like .  This, to my mind, is what constitutes a "
"clear, incontrovertible “A”:  "
"• You have come to at least 90% of our classes on time, ready to participate, and fully "
"present and engaged.  To put my feelings about attendance into perspective, the last time "
"I used a traditiona l grading system, 70% of the final grade was based upon attendance "
and participation. This is not an online course.  The key to success in this class is 
showing up and engaging with the material.  
"• You have engaged deeply with the material, put your best tho ught and effort into each "
"assignment, and turned everything in on time. "
• You’ve committed yourself to working in the spirit of the class. Some of what we do in 
here is unconventional and you may be resistant.  Your willingness to let go of judgement 
"and res istance, and to allow yourself to give in, go with the flow and see where it takes "
"you, is essential to the success of this class.  Equally essential is your willingness to do "
what you can to help foster a sense of connection and community in this classroom – to 
engage with this class with a “we” mentality and to recognize yourself as an integral part 
of the whole.  
One important caveat:  I reserve the right to require you to have a conversation with me if your 
assessment in your self -evaluation seems to m e to be either artificially high or artificially low.  In 
"that event, you might find an “M” (which stands for “missing”) on your transcript at the end of "
the term.  The “M” will stay on your transcript for only one term and is not permanent.  
"However, if you have not resolved your grade through discussion with me by the end of the "
"following term, it will convert to an “X” – and that “X” is permanent and unchangeable.  It "
is your responsibility to understand the implications of both an “M” and an “X” on your  
"transcript, in terms of your standing with financial aid and for your education in general.   "
Side Note: I realize this caveat seems rather intimidating.  I considered rewording it to make it 
"softer, but chose to leave it because it is really important th at you take the process of self -grading "
seriously and don’t mistake my untraditional approach as a ticket to an easy A .  One thing I 
should clarify  is that I will have individual conferences with each of you at the end of the 
term  to discuss your grade and to just talk about how things are going in general. If there is 
any discrepancy between the grade you assigned to yourself and the grade I think you 
"earned, we can discuss it during this meeting.  "
"By remaining in this course, you  agree to the expectations set forth here, including the course "
"requirements, cell phone policy, and the terms for self -grading outlined above. "
Academic Integrity:   
All work turned in must be your own and it must be work that you have done specifically for  this 
"course.  If you submit work that you already turned in for another course, you will receive a zero "
"for that assignment.  More importantly, do not plagiarize , meaning do not copy someone else’s "
"work, (psst! If you are reading this parenthetical aside,  draw a big smiley face on top of the paper "
"with the questions/comments you are turning in next class, and you will receive a small prize), do not cut and paste from the internet, do not use quotes or ideas from someone else without "
"providing citations, and please, please, please do not use ChatGPT or any other AI to write your "
papers.  Plagiarism will result in a zero on the assignment and can result in further 
sanctions including dismissal from Portland State University.  For more information on the 
"conse quences of plagiarism, refer to the student code of conduct:  http://www.pdx.edu/dos/psu -"
student -code -conduct#AcademicDishonesty  
PSU Email Account:  Please make sure th at you have a PSU email account and that you check 
it regularly.  This is the account the university uses to send you important information.  It is also 
the account that your mentor and I will use to get in touch with you.  If you need help getting an 
"account set up, please let me or your mentor know right away so we can help you take care of "
this. 
Accommodations:  Students with disabilities may request appropriate accommodations from the 
Disability Resource Center ( http://www.drc.pdx.edu/ ).  Please see me if you have a disability 
"that requires some modification to this course, and I will work with you and the DRC to make "
necessary arrangements.   
Title XI Statement:  
" As an instructor, students frequently come to me for assistance in matters that are not related to "
"the course material. Please be aware that PSU’s policies require instructors to report any instance of sexual harassment, sexual and relationship violence and/or other forms of prohibited discrimination to University Officials, who keep the information private. If you would rather share information about these experiences with a PSU staff member who does not have these reporting responsibilities and can keep the information confidential, please contact one of the following campus resources."
"• Confidential Advocates: 503.894.7982, or by  scheduling on-line  (for mat ters regarding sexual "
harassment and sexual and relationship violence)  
"• Center for Student Health and Counseling (SHAC) : 1880 SW 6th Ave, 503.725.2800  "
"• Student Legal Services : 1825 SW Broadway, (SMSU) M343, 503.725.4556 For more "
"information, please complete the required student module Understanding Sexual Misconduct and "
Resources in Canvas.  
PSU Sexual Misconduct Response website  gives you comprehensive information about 
how to support and/or report an incident.  
Please complete the required student module  Understanding Sexual Misconduct and Resources  in 
"Canvas, which provides information about PSU policy and resources.  "
You may also report sexual and relationship violence to law enforcement on campus with  Campus 
Public Safety Office (CPSO).  
Or you may fi le an  anonymous report  with Campus Public Safety Office  or a Bias Incident 
report  with the  Bias Review Team (BRT).   PSU does not typically investigate the reports that are made 
through these two avenues. These reports help PSU understand what students and employees are 
experiencing on and around campus and pr ovide support where needed.   Course Outline :

Freshman Inquiry and Its Goals  
Freshman Inquir y is a yearlong course with an approach to learning that differs from many other 
educational programs. It is based on a concept of collaboration and commitment among the 
"faculty, peer mentors, and students in creating and developing a learning  community, "
characterized by respect and responsibility. Learning occurs through participation in collective 
and individual efforts. The goals of University Studies (of which Freshman Inquiry is only your 
first step) are to develop and strengthen skills th at will be crucial to your academic success and 
lifelong achievements. Achieving these goals will result in:  
• A set of conceptual tools for critical thinking and inquiry  
"• An ability to use key modes of communication  such as writing, oral presentation and "
"discussion, computer application, numerical information, and graphics  "
"• A deeper understanding of diversity, equity and social justice  with a focus on  "
identity and power relations in the past and in our own times  
• An awareness of crucial issues involving ethics  and social responsibility  
These four general goals constitute the necessary conditions for achievement in a broad array of 
professions. FRINQ classes approach them from an interdisciplinary perspective  in preparation 
"for more advanced study. Furthermore, the course encourages students to embrace non -western "
cultural practices and critical modes of thought. It is important for you to focus on  these goals 
"throughout the year, as you will need to demonstrate your understanding in your E -portfolios . "
"Course Fo rmat: The course material consists of critical research, fiction, non -fiction, and films. "
"Classes will be conducted in mixed format combining lectures, student presentations, and "
discussions.  
Required Course Materials : There will be no books to purchase this term. All readings will be 
made available online through Canvas.  
Course Content  
This course examines the nature and history of public health as fundamental human right. A 
"social justice approach will be used to study the places in which people live and interact, such as "
"the community, the workplace, and the natural environment. Specific emphasis will be given to "
"social determinants of health or the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work, "
"play, and age. These circumstances are sha ped by social, cultural, political, technological, and "
economic forces and impact the general “happiness” in our society. Historical and contemporary 
case studies will help us understand power relationships as access to (or lack thereof) health 
"service, fo od, education, and shelter as human rights. We can only scratch the surface of these "
complex issues but the readings and assignments are designed to introduce you to ideas that will 
apply to your other classes as well as your own life experience.  
 In the fall term  we explored various aspects of social and racial injustice in public health and 
education through the lens of human rights. We also began the important process of becoming 
critical thinkers and getting to know each other and establishing an atmos phere in the classroom 
of trust in each other and for our ideas. We will continue to explore the themes of this class by 
deepening our understanding of global injustices in multiple directions.  
"In winter term, we will engage in more hands -on research and investigation of specific instances "
of human rights and health concerns in the era of globalization and climate change . We will 
explore aspects of global injustice through research and artistic ways for its critique. We will 
"focus on global crises  related to the availability of water and food , and the impact of "
environmental disasters . We will challenge our first -world assumptions about health and human 
rights. We will develop the skills for writing a research paper . 
"In spring  term, we will move out of the classroom (hopefully, to some degree) to engage in "
community -based learning projects. You will be working with people in the community who are 
"impacted in very real ways by social disempowerment and how they find creative solutions.  Thus, "
"the focus will be on various political and  social movements , mechanisms of change, and forms "
of empowerment . We will question what our own responsibilities as members of society are; 
"what are the ethical boundaries of promoting one’s own perspective . Thus, we will keep "
"developing our understanding of diverse perspectives and empathy. In terms of skills, you will be "
working on how to communicate your experience in leading class discussions and writing a 
letter to a policy maker .  
Learning Objectives:  Learning objectives for the course are based on the UNST four goals. To 
"achieve them, you will be expected to engage in the following:  "
1. Practice the conceptualization and expression of ideas.  
"2. Recognize and respectfully defend or challenge the underl ying assumptions in our readings, "
"discussion, and other learning activities.  "
"3. Summarize, analyze, interpret, and evaluate research material.  "
"4. Collaborate with peers on written, oral, and computer -based projects.  "
"5. Examine variations in access to funda mental human rights affected by factors such as gender, "
"race, class, ethnicity, nationality, sexual identity, ability, religion, and age.  "
"6. Critically assess the production, dissemination, and control of knowledge by powerful societal "
"forces such as the s tate, corporations, academia, religion, the scientific community, and the "
media.  
7. Explain and discuss historical and contemporary attitudes towards individuals and groups who 
challenge accepted beliefs and hierarchies of power.  
8. Understand ethical fram eworks that shape or limit the actions of citizens and institutions.  
Class organization  
This term we will be reading articles and book chapters that you will find on the Canvas Class 
Website: Go to the designated folder in Canvas  
"Log In to Canvas , using your ODIN name and password.  "
"Assignments, announcements, and assignment feedback will be posted on Canvas, and we will "
"conduct online discussions on the site. Please check it regularly, along with your PSU email "
account.  
Please attach all files as PDFs .  
Mentor Sessions : You will have mentor sessions and your mentor will guide you through 
specific projects and activities.   
Class Participation and Discussion:  Hearing from others allows us to understand various 
"perspective and different points of view, and shows us how experience and knowledge can shape "
"our views. This term more than ever, though, participation is also about keeping connected, and "
"supporting and  looking out for each other. With than in mind, try to ask for help from and, in "
"turn, provide support to others; challenge yourself to learn and take risks; and work to "
communicate with empathy and clarity.  
Keep in mind these touchstones  that will help to guide our class discussions.  
• Encourage an environment of respect  where differing points of view and experiences are 
recognized.  
• Allow room for others to speak and raise your hand so that the class has time to recognize 
who wants to spea k (we will try to use the “raise hand” function in Zoom).  
• Cell phones and other technology generally prevent us from being fully present in a 
conversation (this applies to remote conversations as well).  
• Recognize and respect forms of nonverbal communicatio n. 
• Embrace active listening as essential to creating a good dialogue.  
Assessment and Grading  
"Note: CANVAS is not a grading tool, it’s just a platform for communication.  "
Assessment in this class is based on formal assignments and class participation. List ed below is a 
percentage breakdown of the major graded components of the class.  
Attendance  & Participation      25% 
Written Assignments  (Film response & 3 reading logs)   25% 
  Mentor session        15% 
  Research project (6 -8pages)*      35% 
"*The project inc ludes many sub -assignments: Topic; Website; Annotated bibliography, "
Thesis/outline; individual presentation; paper  
It is your responsibility to keep track of the due dates for all homework and reading assignments.  
Keep in mind that your final grade will reflect your  performance in this class -- you 
"are responsible for your grade and the work you turn in, so please do not hesitate "
to take advantage of my willingness to help you throughout the term.  
Grading key  
"The gr ading will be on a traditional scale of 100 –95=A, 94 –90= A -, 89–88=B+, 87 –83=B, 82 –"
"80=B -, 79–78=C+, 77 –70=C, 69 –60=D.  "
A-level work will demonstrate mastery of the material and will go far beyond the minimum 
"requirements of a particular assignment; in addi tion, there will be few or no mistakes.  "
B-level work will exceed the requirements of an assignment and demonstrate strong competency 
"with the material; some mistakes, but no egregious errors.  "
C-level work will meet the requirements of an assignment but d emonstrate only basic 
comprehension of the material; some mistakes and potentially a major error.  
D-level work will fail to meet the requirements of an assignment and demonstrate little or no

You must come to each class having read the assigned materials carefully. Participation includes 
"listening and responding to other students. No matter how much you talk, if you do not respect "
"the class, you will receive a low grade in class participation.  "
"Regarding attendance and participation, the following represents the criteria that I use for "
evaluation purposes:  • Does the student respond to other students’ comments or questions?  
• Does the student raise questions  or comments that receive commentary from others?  
• Does the student refer to a course text in a way so the class can follow along?  
"• Overall, does the student participate in a meaningful way to the discussion?  "
Never Rarely Seldom Occasionally Sometimes Fre quently Always  
General Policies  
Make yourself familiar with the following policies so that you understand clearly what is 
expected of you as a student in this class. These policies will remain the same throughout the year 
and our class will operate on th e principle that you are acquainted with them (not knowing a 
policy will not excuse you from its enforcement):  
Attendance:  Attendance is required in BOTH main class and mentor session and attendance will 
count toward your grade.  
You could miss up to FIVE  classes  total (three main and two mentor sessions) during the term. 
More than 5 absences will slide down your grade by one letter.  
"• If you are more than 10 minutes late to class, you will be marked absent.  "
If you are going to miss class for an extended period of time because of exceptional 
circumstances do get in touch with me.  
Late work:  No late work will be accepted (except in compelling circumstances).  
"E-mail policy : I check my work email regularly and try to respond in a timely fashion. However, "
please keep in mind the following:  
• Please use professional language when communicating with me by email. Emails should 
"begin and end with salutations (e.g. Dear Professor Davidova), should include your name, "
"and be written using proper spelling, grammar, a nd punctuation. These are foundational "
professional skills that are important to function both inside and out of the university.  
• I will not respond to any emails sent to me from non- @pdx.edu e -mails.  
"• Please state your question or comment as clearly as po ssible. Before sending an email, "
please make sure you have explored all other avenues for answering questions. For 
"example, look to the syllabus/assignment before asking about due dates or readings.  "
Written Work :  
"• Double space  all your written work and leave one-inch margins all around , (some "
"versions of Word set the margins at 1.25 inches, so please adjust your margins as "
necessary).  
• You must use a Times New Roman 12 -point font.  
"• Always use grammatically correct sentence and pa ragraph structure, punctuation, and "
spelling.  
• SAVE EVERYTHING IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT  (you’ll use your assignments 
"throughout the year for your E -portfolio), and make sure to save your documents in two "
different places.  
General Conduct and Maintaining a Resp ectful Learning Environment: We will do our best 
"to cultivate a classroom atmosphere that is based on mutual respect . During our discussions, you "
"may hear statements, opinions, and arguments that sound absurd to you or that vary significantly "
from your own  ideas. It is important to remember that students in this class come from diverse 
backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of perspectives. It is not necessary that you like 
"other people’s opinions, only that you listen to and engage them with utmost r espect. I will expect you to conduct yourself appropriately, which means acting in the same manner you would in any "
professional environment.  
Plagiarism:  We expect that the writing you do for this course will be your own work. You 
"violate this ethic if y ou copy materials without acknowledging the source, present a slightly "
"rearranged wording of source materials as your own, or submit a copy of a paper identical to that "
submitted by another student. Plagiarism will result in a zero grade for the assignment  and 
possibly lead to more severe academic consequences. A second offense may be sent through the 
Code of Conduct process where an outcome may be a failing grade in the class or suspension 
"from the University. If something is questionable, ask your mentor or professor.  "
Policy Enforcement: If you are found disregarding any of these policies in class or in mentor 
"session, you will be warned once. If you choose to continue the behavior, you will be dismissed "
from main and/or mentor class and the day will coun t as an absence. You will not be allowed to 
return to class or mentor lab until you have discussed your behavior with me.  
PSU Code of Student Conduct and Responsibility : As with all other classes at PSU conduct

Please be aware that a ll PSU faculty members and instructors  are required to report  information 
"of an incident that may constitute prohibited discrimination, including sexual harassment and "
sexual and relationship violence. This means that if you tell me about a situation of se xual 
"harassment or discrimination, I have to share the information with the University’s Title IX "

Or you may file an  anonymous report  with Campus Public Safety Office  or a Bias Incident 
report  with the  Bias Review Team (BRT).   PSU does not typically investigate the reports that are 
made through these two avenues. These reports help PSU understand what students and 
employees are experiencing on and around campus and provide support where needed.  
The Disability Resource Center:  PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to 
fostering mutual respect and full part icipation for all students. My goal is to create a learning

in barriers to your inclusion or learning. I will work with you  and the Disability Resource Center 
to arrange specific supports.  
"We are here because we want you to succeed, and it is your responsibility to ask for help when you "
"need it. If you are having problems with the course, with time management, or with your fr eshman "

Welcome Statement  
You—and everyone else —are welcome here!  Portland State University attracts a marvelously 
"varied group of first -year students, people with diverse ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, "
"religious and political beliefs, people whose families are from all over the globe. In a world, "
"nation, state , and city with rigid racial, economic, cultural, and political divides, PSU offers the "
"rare opportunity to know, learn from, and befriend a wide range of people as particular human "
"beings, even as we form a community that is greater than the sum of its pa rts. I (David) can "
honestly say that teaching FRINQ since 2017 has profoundly changed and deepened my life and 
brought me much more satisfaction than any other work I had done in the sixty years before that.  
Course Description  
  The movement of people ac ross borders is a central political and cultural issue 
throughout the world. Although many are aware of the mobility of goods and capital in a global 
"economy, we tend to be less aware of the movement of people in the global economic system "
"and we also tend  forget that the movement of people, both as workers and as refugees as well as "
"of people seeking more cosmopolitan experiences, is not a new phenomenon.  "
"As implied by the course title, the question of belonging is central to this class. "
"Immigrants and the ir children often feel out of place and struggle to find a place, actual or "
"emotional, where they feel as if they belong. Winter term we shall in fact focus on the tension or "
relationship between individual freedom and choice on the one hand and responsibi lity and 
"obligation toward others (family, community, nation, and indeed people across the globe) on the "
other hand. And we shall work out that tension in our own class by listening to and supporting 
each other. We shall continue to create a place where we  can all experience a sense of acceptance 
"and belonging, where we will learn not just about and from each other, but how to sustain each "
other.  
We shall spend most of winter  term studying the experiences of refugees and some 
"elements of the politics of immigration. But this academic study will be informed and supplemented by our exploration, individually and together, of how we balance our "
responsibilities to ourselves and to  others.  
This five -credit freshman seminar features one Mentored Inquiry session a week as a co -
requisite. These mentor sessions are just as important as the large class meeting. Our expectation 
as instructors is that all of us will come prepared to work h ard for the duration of each 
"class.  Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course (five credits each term) that, upon successful "
"completion, conveys 4 credits each in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and "
3 credits in Writing. The course is de signed to inculcate particular skills necessary to succeed as 
"a student, citizen, and human being: research, writing, speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, "
"empathy, and a passion for kindness.  "
University Studies Vision  
"Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously in imagining and co -"
creating a just world.   
University Studies Mission  
"Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry -based pedagog  "
• Provokes students to build self -efficacy through relational learning acro ss difference  
• Encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for transformative 
learning  
"• Advances civic engagement, reflective practice, and the scholarship of teaching and "
learning  
University Studies Goals  
• Inquiry and Critical Thinking: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to "
"become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
• Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to commun icate in various ways —
"writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively "
"with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication "
technologies.  
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will expl ore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from "
multiple perspectives.  
"• Ethics, Agency, and Community:  Students will examine values, theories and practices "
"that inform their actions, a nd reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact "
local and global communities.

"Use evidence from Judis to support your answer, your thesis, to answer one of these questions: "
1) Does nationalism necessarily lead to racism and a desire to restrict immigration?  
2) In what sense can nationalism lead to the “transcending of the self” (27)?  
"3) Are people’s positions on immigration largely determined by their economic self -interest, or "
does it have more to do with social and cultural factors?  
"4) Based on this book, how might you as an individual counter anti -immigrant beliefs and "
policies?  
5) Is nationalism an expression of power and privilege or a reaction to losing power and 
privilege ?

Assignments  
Attendance  
Regular participation is perhaps the most essential part of this class and is worth 40 points (and 
40 percent) of your grade. There will be 50 class meetings  (2 50 -minute sessions in large class 
"each Tuesday and Thursday and one peer mentor class on Tuesda ys), and you lose .8 for each "
class (large or peer mentor) that you miss and .4 points for each class you are more than five 
"minutes late for. Unless you are ill, have an emergency, or have made arrangements with the "
"instructor, you are expected and requir ed to attend the class meetings, both for the large class and "
"your peer mentor session. If you miss a class meeting for reasons that your instructor agrees are beyond your control, or to observe a religious holiday, you can make them up by arrangement "
with the instructor for large sessions or the Peer Mentor for peer -mentor sessions. It is up to you 
to contact them promptly  (within two days of missing the class)  for instructions on how to make 
up the class. You los e .4 point s of attendance for the classes i n which we discuss the readings 
"even if you are present, if you do not have notes on the readings done by the time of class.  "
Reflections  
Your weekly reflections should be at least 300 words and address both personal and 
"social aspects of your life and wee k. Of course, more is always welcome. The reflections can be "
"shared with the class on the reflection’s forum in Canvas Discussion, or, if you want to keep "
"them private, by emailing them (delmard@pdx.edu) to David  or posting them in the Canvas "
Assignments.  
Your personal reflection is about how your week was. Did you encounter any special 
"challenges or difficulties at school, work, or home life? Is there anything on your mind or that "
you are upset about? What sort of progress do you see yourself making? Are t here any 
achievements from this week that you are proud of?  
Your social reflection is more about your impact on the broader world. How did you do 
"in class participation? What areas of improvement do you see, and areas where you might "
improve? In what ways did you encourage or listen to someone this week? What did you learn 
from other people this week? Do you have any appreciations you would like David to pass along 
"to our guest speakers? If you did any service work, how was that? Of course, include hours "
"worked, and where, but also: 1) What did you do? 2) What did you think and feel while "
"working? How did your previous knowledge and expectations shape your experience, your "
reactions? Why did you feel about what you did? 3) So what? What did you learn about 
yourself? 4) Now what? What is your plan for next time? Will you try to do anything differently? 
What?  
Reflections that are less than 300 words or that are posted late without having requested 
an extension will not get full credit. (See Late Policies.)  
Notes on Reading  
"By the start of large class on Thursday, from weeks #2 to #7, you must turn in at least a page of "
notes or reflections on the readings for the week. Hand them in at the start of class or post them 
in the Assignments section of our Canvas site. I strongly recommend that your notes focus on 
material that will be helpful to you in writing the essays. Each set of satisfactory notes that are 
turned in on time receive s 1.5 points. The notes can be handwritten or typed. If you do not turn 
"in note s by the time of class, you will only receive half credit for attending that class.  "
Shorter Essays  
"The two short essays should not exceed 600 words, though you do not have to count the Works "
"Cited page, references within the text, or page numbers or other  headings. There is no minimum "
"word requirement, though of course the more evidence you present to support your thesis, the "
stronger the essay will be. Use the MLA (Modern Language Association) guidelines for all your 
essays or any other work that includes  references. Here is a set of guidelines with examples . This 
"term I will be taking off 3% for each major error, including: incorrect or missing pagination; "
"incorrect spacing in body, paragraph indentations; incorrect four -line heading; missing "
"references in the text; book titles not italicized; missing or inco rrect Works Cited page.  There are sample essays on our D2L site, one from David written many years ago and one from a previous "
"FRINQ on the first essay. If you would like to present one of the two essays in an alternative, "
"non-written feedback, please chec k with David, and you are also welcome to write on a question "
of your own choosing if you get David’s approval.

Group Presentation  
"We shall work out the details of this together, but you will have the last three weeks of the term "
to work to work in self -selected groups to create group presentations about why we should care 
"about a particular author, artist, TV show, or film that you, as a group, decide to study.  "
Final Essay/Project  
"We shall work out the details of this together, but you will write an essay or create a piece of art "
"(song, painting, dance, song, poem, drawing, sculpture, with an explanation) on how the people "
"we have read, watched, and listened to have informed how you balance your responsibilities to "
others with your personal freedom.  
Participatio n/Extra Credit  
The instructor will arrive at your participation grade by considering: your attendance; the 
quality of the presentations and other work created in small groups; peer evaluations of your work in small groups; your self -evaluation. Up to three  points of extra credit can be earned for 
"outstanding participation, including for outstanding work in the peer -mentor ses sions . Regular "
"attendance is essential to getting a high participation grade, as is fully participating in all group "
and other class activities.  
You can get up to two extra -credit points by doing service work. There are some options 
"noted in the Syllabus s ection of Canvas for both in -person or online work, and of course if you "
"are already volunteering at church, mosque, or a community organization, just let me know. You "
"get 1 point for every five hours, up to 2 points (10 hours). Service hours should be rep orted in "
your weekly reflections.  
You get one point for meeting with David one to one and lose one point if you do not 
meet with him.  
Late Policies  
 I usually accept late work without penalty if students notify me before the due date that 
they will need more time because of personal emergencies. I’ll give you one extension per term 
"if you need it just because you are extra busy at that time, but it is a really good idea to get in the "
habit of loo king and planning ahead so all of your work can be turned in on time. If 
circumstances keep you from notifying me before a deadline that you cannot turn an assignment 
"in, let me know as soon as you can. Otherwise, late work will be penalized 10 percent for  each "
day it is late for up to one week. Then it will receive a mark of zero.  
 Requests for the grade of incomplete must be received by the day and time of the last 
"assignment, and such requests will not necessarily be granted.  Students must have complete d at "
least half of the work for the course to receive an incomplete.  If you are unable to keep up with 
"the work of the course during the first half of the term, you should drop the course as soon as "
possible.  
Plagiarism  
It is cheating to pass off the wor k of others as your own.  This includes using the words of others 
without attribution (be sure to use quotation marks and indicating the source of the words) and 
using the words of your fellow students.  Your instructor takes such violations of the ethical  code 
very seriously and will penalize violators as severely as the university allows.  Consequences can 
include failing the class and having the violation noted on your permanent university record. 
Canvas has a Turn -It-In function that enables you to see if you are using other people’s work or 
not. But note that you may have a high score simply because you have quoted other people’s 
"work, so a high score does not necessarily mean that you have committed plagiarism.  "
Accessibility  
It is Portland State Unive rsity's goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. If you 
"anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please register with "
the Disability Resource Center  (DRC) (503 -725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu ) in order to establish 
"reasonable accommodations. Once you have registered with the DRC, please schedule a time to "
talk to me so that we can discuss your needs for the term.  
 Mandatory Reporters  
"PSU strives to address sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, domestic & dating "
"violence, and stalking, in a trauma informed manner. This means that people impacted by sexual "
harassment are provided resources to assist them in addressing sexual harassment in the manne r 
that is best for the person who experienced the harassment. PSU requires all faculty and most 
"staff to report any incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence or "
gender -based stalking that they become aware of. The purpose of reporting the matter is to make 
sure the University provides the impacted person with resources and available complaint 
"processes. If the matter pertains to a student, the report may be made to the  CARE team  through "
"the CARE incident report . Otherwise, you may report the matter to PSU’s Title IX Coordinator "
by emailing her at  titleixcoordinator@pdx.edu . Please make sure you inform the person who has 
disclosed being sexually harassed that you have an obligation to report it to university officials 
"who will keep the information private. If necessary, a Title IX Coordinator or someone from the "
Dean of Student Life will contact you with any follow -up information.

Welcome Statement  
You—and everyone else —are welcome here!  Portland State University attracts a marvelously 
"varied group of first -year students, people with diverse ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, "
"religious and political beliefs, people whose families are from all over the globe. In a world, "
"nation, state , and city with rigid racial, economic, cultural, and political divides, PSU offers the "
"rare opportunity to know, learn from, and befriend a wide range of people as particular human "
"beings, even as we form a community that is greater than the sum of its pa rts. I (David) can "
honestly say that teaching FRINQ since 2017 has profoundly changed and deepened my life and 
brought me much more satisfaction than any other work I had done in the sixty years before that.  
Course Description  
  The movement of people ac ross borders is a central political and cultural issue 
throughout the world. Although many are aware of the mobility of goods and capital in a global 
"economy, we tend to be less aware of the movement of people in the global economic system "
"and we also tend  forget that the movement of people, both as workers and as refugees as well as "
"of people seeking more cosmopolitan experiences, is not a new phenomenon.  "
"As implied by the course title, the question of belonging is central to this class. "
"Immigrants and the ir children often feel out of place and struggle to find a place, actual or "
"emotional, where they feel as if they belong. Winter term we shall in fact focus on the tension or "
relationship between individual freedom and choice on the one hand and responsibi lity and 
"obligation toward others (family, community, nation, and indeed people across the globe) on the "
other hand. And we shall work out that tension in our own class by listening to and supporting 
each other. We shall continue to create a place where we  can all experience a sense of acceptance 2 
"and belonging, where we will learn not just about and from each other, but how to sustain each "
other.  
We shall spend most of winter  term studying the experiences of refugees and some 
elements of the politics of immigration. But this academic study will be informed and 
"supplemented by our exploration, individually and together, of how we balance our "
responsibilities to ourselves and to  others.  
This five -credit freshman seminar features one Mentored Inquiry session a week as a co -
requisite. These mentor sessions are just as important as the large class meeting. Our expectation 
as instructors is that all of us will come prepared to work h ard for the duration of each 
"class.  Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course (five credits each term) that, upon successful "
"completion, conveys 4 credits each in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and "
3 credits in Writing. The course is de signed to inculcate particular skills necessary to succeed as 
"a student, citizen, and human being: research, writing, speaking, critical thinking, collaboration, "
"empathy, and a passion for kindness.  "
University Studies Vision  
"Challenging us to think holistically, care deeply, and engage courageously in imagining and co -"
creating a just world.   
University Studies Mission  
"Our inclusive, interdisciplinary, and inquiry -based pedagog  "
• Provokes students to build self -efficacy through relational learning acro ss difference  
• Encourages a community of educators to practice engaged teaching for transformative 
learning  
"• Advances civic engagement, reflective practice, and the scholarship of teaching and "
learning  
University Studies Goals  
• Inquiry and Critical Thinking: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through 
"interdisciplinary curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to "
"become active, self -motivated, and empowered learners.  "
• Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to commun icate in various ways —
"writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively "
"with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication "
technologies.  
"• Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will expl ore and analyze identity, power "
"relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from "
multiple perspectives.

Assignments  
Attendance  
Regular participation is perhaps the most essential part of this class and is worth 40 points (and 
40 percent) of your grade. There will be 50 class meetings  (2 50 -minute sessions in large class 
"each Tuesday and Thursday and one peer mentor class on Tuesda ys), and you lose .8 for each "
class (large or peer mentor) that you miss and .4 points for each class you are more than five 
"minutes late for. Unless you are ill, have an emergency, or have made arrangements with the "
"instructor, you are expected and requir ed to attend the class meetings, both for the large class and "
your peer mentor session. If you miss a class meeting for reasons that your instructor agrees are 7 
"beyond your control, or to observe a religious holiday, you can make them up by arrangement "
with the instructor for large sessions or the Peer Mentor for peer -mentor sessions. It is up to you 
to contact them promptly  (within two days of missing the class)  for instructions on how to make 
up the class. You los e .4 point s of attendance for the classes i n which we discuss the readings 
"even if you are present, if you do not have notes on the readings done by the time of class.  "
Reflections  
Your weekly reflections should be at least 300 words and address both personal and 
"social aspects of your life and wee k. Of course, more is always welcome. The reflections can be "
"shared with the class on the reflection’s forum in Canvas Discussion, or, if you want to keep "
"them private, by emailing them (delmard@pdx.edu) to David  or posting them in the Canvas "
Assignments.  
Your personal reflection is about how your week was. Did you encounter any special 
"challenges or difficulties at school, work, or home life? Is there anything on your mind or that "
you are upset about? What sort of progress do you see yourself making? Are t here any 
achievements from this week that you are proud of?  
Your social reflection is more about your impact on the broader world. How did you do 
"in class participation? What areas of improvement do you see, and areas where you might "
improve? In what ways did you encourage or listen to someone this week? What did you learn 
from other people this week? Do you have any appreciations you would like David to pass along 
"to our guest speakers? If you did any service work, how was that? Of course, include hours "
"worked, and where, but also: 1) What did you do? 2) What did you think and feel while "
"working? How did your previous knowledge and expectations shape your experience, your "
reactions? Why did you feel about what you did? 3) So what? What did you learn about 
yourself? 4) Now what? What is your plan for next time? Will you try to do anything differently? 
What?  
Reflections that are less than 300 words or that are posted late without having requested 
an extension will not get full credit. (See Late Policies.)  
Notes on Reading  
"By the start of large class on Thursday, from weeks #2 to #7, you must turn in at least a page of "
notes or reflections on the readings for the week. Hand them in at the start of class or post them 
in the Assignments section of our Canvas sit e. I strongly recommend that your notes focus on 
material that will be helpful to you in writing the essays. Each set of satisfactory notes that are 
turned in on time receive s 1.5 points. The notes can be handwritten or typed. If you do not turn 
"in notes b y the time of class, you will only receive half credit for attending that class.  "
Shorter Essays  
"The two short essays should not exceed 600 words, though you do not have to count the Works "
"Cited page, references within the text, or page numbers or other headings. There is no minimum "
"word requirement, though of course the more evidence you present to s upport your thesis, the "
stronger the essay will be. Use the MLA (Modern Language Association) guidelines for all your 
essays or any other work that includes references. Here is a set of guidelines with examples . This 
"term I will be taking off 3% for each major error, including: incorrect or missing pagination; "
"incorrect spacing  in body, paragraph indentations ; incorre ct four -line heading; missing "
references in the text; book titles no t italicized; missing or incorrect Works Cited page.  There are 8 
"sample essays on our D2L site, one from David written many years ago and one from  a previous "
"FRINQ on the first essay . If you would like to present one of the two essays in an alternative, "
"non-written feedback, please check with David, and you are also welcome to write on a question "
of your own choosing if you get David’s approval.

Group Presentation  
"We shall work out the details of this together, but you will have the last three weeks of the term "
to work to work in self -selected groups to create group presentations about why we should care 
"about a particular author, artist, TV show, or film that you, as a group, decide to study.  "
Final Essay/Project  
"We shall work out the details of this together, but you will write an essay or create a piece of art "
"(song, painting, dance, song, poem, drawing, sculpture, with an explanation) on how the people "
"we have read, watched, and listened to have informed how you balance your responsibilities to "
others with your personal freedom.  
Participatio n/Extr a Credit  
The instructor will arrive at your participation grade by considering: your attendance; the 
quality of the presentations and other work created in small groups; peer evaluations of your 9 
work in small groups; your self -evaluation. Up to three  points of extra credit can be earned for 
"outstanding participation, including for outstanding work in the peer -mentor sessions . Regular "
"attendance is essential to getting a high participation grade, as is fully participating in all group "
and other class a ctivities.  
You can get up to two extra -credit points by doing service work. There are some options 
"noted in the Syllabus section of Canvas for both in -person or online work, and of course if you "
"are already volunteering at church, mosque, or a community organization, just let me know. You "
"get 1 point for every five hours, up to 2 points (10 hours). Service hours should be reported in "
your weekly reflections.  
You get one point for meeting with David one to one and lose one point if you do not 
meet with him . 
Late Policies  
 I usually accept late work without penalty if students notify me before the due date that 
they will need more time because of personal emergencies. I’ll give you one extension per term 
"if you need it just because you are extra busy at tha t time, but it is a really good idea to get in the "
habit of looking and planning ahead so all of your work can be turned in on time. If 
circumstances keep you from notifying me before a deadline that you cannot turn an assignment 
"in, let me know as soon as  you can. Otherwise, late work will be penalized 10 percent for each "
day it is late for up to one week. Then it will receive a mark of zero.  
 Requests for the grade of incomplete must be received by the day and time of the last 
"assignment, and such request s will not necessarily be granted.  Students must have completed at "
least half of the work for the course to receive an incomplete.  If you are unable to keep up with 
"the work of the course during the first half of the term, you should drop the course as s oon as "
possible.  
Plagiarism  
It is cheating to pass off the work of others as your own.  This includes using the words of others 
without attribution (be sure to use quotation marks and indicating the source of the words) and 
using the words of your fellow students.  Your instructor takes such violations of the ethical code 
very seriously and will penalize violators as severely as the university allows.  Consequences can 
include failing the class and having the violation noted on your permanent university re cord. 
Canvas has a Turn -It-In function that enables you to see if you are using other people’s work or 
not. But note that you may have a high score simply because you have quoted other people’s 
"work, so a high score does not necessarily mean that you have committed plagiarism.  "
Accessibility  
It is Portland State University's goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. If you 
"anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, please register with "
the Disability Resource Center  (DRC) (503 -725-4150 or drc@pdx.edu ) in order to establish 
"reasonable accommodations. Once you have registered with the DRC, please schedule a time to "
talk to me so that we can discuss your ne eds for the term.

Mandatory Reporters  
"PSU strives to address sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, domestic & dating "
"violence, and stalking, in a trauma informed manner. This means that people impacted by sexual "
harassment are provided resources to assist them in addressing sexual harassment in the manner 
that is best for the person who experienced the harassment. PSU requires all faculty and most 
"staff to report any incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic viol ence or "
gender -based stalking that they become aware of. The purpose of reporting the matter is to make 
sure the University provides the impacted person with resources and available complaint 
"processes. If the matter pertains to a student, the report may b e made to the  CARE team  through "
"the CARE incident report . Otherwise, you may report the matter to PSU’s Title IX Coordinator "
by emailing her at  titleixcoordinator@pdx.edu . Please make sure you inform the person who has 
disclosed being sexually harassed that you have an obligation to report it to university of ficials 
"who will keep the information private. If necessary, a Title IX Coordinator or someone from the "

UNST 10 8C: PORTLAND        
Winter 2024  
Monday/Wednesday 11:30am -1:20 pm    Location: Parkmill 11  
Instructor: Dr. Leanne Serbulo     Mentor: Hannah Booth  
Contact: serbulo@pdx.edu      Mentor Contact: hbooth@pdx.edu  
"Office hours: Mon/Wed 8 -8:45 AM, 1:30 -2:00 PM  "
Office location: Cramer Hall Room 117  
Course Description:  
Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is the city of Portland) from 
"an interdisciplinary  (incorporating two or  more types of knowledge)  perspective.  In this course, we will "
"use the city of Portland to uncover how place shapes our lives, and how we, in turn, shape the places we "
live in.  We will examine the city as a context for human development and cultural expr ession; as an 
"urban area of diverse communities; and as part of the larger natural, material, and social environment of "
the Pacific Northwest.  We will discuss what connects people to their place(s) as well as what makes their 
"place(s) part of their social , cultural, spiritual, economic and political life.  We will read broadly, touching "
"on the social sciences (urban studies, sociology, political science) and humanities (history, literature, arts).  "
We will use the city as our laboratory as we explore the c ommunities and spaces of greater Portland.  
University Studies Learning Goals:  
"University Studies courses focus on four main learning goals.  Throughout this course, you will develop "
your skills in these areas:  
"Communication: Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, "
"graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group "
"work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
Critical Thinking and Inquiry: Student s will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary 
"curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, "
and empowered learners.  
"Diversity, Equity and Social Justice: Students will explore and anal yze identity, power relationships, "
and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.  
"Ethics, Agency and Community: Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their "
"actions, and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.  "
Course Learning Outcomes  
"As a result of this course, students will be able to:  "
"• Analyze the various political, geological, economic, and social factors that help shape Portland.  "
• Examine various factors that lead to both a “sense of place” and to displacement.  
"• Recognize the importance of equity as we explore Portland as a city, and t he significance of a "
multidisciplinary approach to investigating the city.  
• Develop inquiry and critical thinking skills that help us address important social issues.  
"• Use evidence as a means to deepen understanding of an issue, solve problems, discover new  "
"ideas, develop perspective on a topic, and/or effectively convey a point of view to others.  "
"• Develop skills of observation, civic engagement, dialogue, and analysis; practice being a deep "
listener.   
"• Make use of the writing process, including brainstorming , drafting, workshopping, revising, "
"editing, and proofreading work.  "
"• Find, evaluate, synthesize, and analyze a variety of primary and secondary sources, and use "
appropriate means of documentation for those sources.  
"• Synthesize materials, developing your own perspective as you integrate your own ideas and "
experiences with those of others.  
Course Policies:  
"In this course, we will engage in inquiry -based learning. Unlike traditional modes of learning where the "
instruct or presents information and students are tested on their ability to retain or understand that 
"information, an inquiry -based classroom focuses on exploring ideas and concepts through discussion or "
other participatory activities. This style of education requ ires student engagement and active participation. 
Our goal is to create a community of teachers and learners where everyone’s unique perspectives and 
experiences help broaden our collective understanding of key ideas and concepts.  
"For this type of learnin g to work well, everyone has to participate and be involved. The following course "
policies are designed to facilitate inquiry -based learning:  
Participation:  
"Please come to class on time , prepared (with books or assignments, a notebook, and pen)  and ready to "
"participate. In this class, we will be engaged in discussions and other forms of active learning where every "
"student’s contribution matters. Your questions, insights, and ideas will help us build our collective "
knowledge base. If you are in class and are not engaged (listening and paying attention even if you choose 
"not to speak)  and/or are disruptive, you may not receive credit for that day’s work.  "
Electronics:  
"Research shows that even when laptops or tablets are being used for an academic purpose, they can "
"distract from class discussions. No laptop, tablet, cell phone , and ear bud use permitted during class "
time. You will have a break in the middle of class wher e you can check your phone or listen to music. But 
"while class is in session, you should put your electronics away. We will occasionally have class activities "
"that require computers. During those activities, you may use your laptop or cell phone to conduct  "
research. You can also use a computer in the mentor lab. I will let you know when the use of personal 
electronics is permitted.  
Assignments/Late work:  
“Finished crap can be edited. Unfinished greatness languishes forever” ― Margarita Gakis   
"In other words, get it done, and get it done on time!  I don’t accept late work.  In most cases, students who "
turn-in late work don’t turn in any higher quality wor k than those who turn their work in by the due date.  
Part of our learning this year is figuring out how to prioritize work and how to effectively manage your 
time.  
Let’s Talk  
"No matter how much time and effort you devote to your schoolwork, sometimes life just gets in the way. "
"If something unexpected comes up that prevents you from attending class or completing an assignment, "
"please come and talk to me. If you find yourself str uggling to stay motivated or to get work done, let’s "
"chat. If you don’t understand an assignment or can’t make sense of a reading, let me know. FRINQ "
courses are designed to be supportive. Our goal is to help you develop the skills you will need to be 
"successful in higher education. We don’t expect you to be a stellar college student right away, but we also "
won’t necessarily know that you are struggling if you don’t talk to us.  
Your mentor and I are both available to talk to you. You can chat with us befo re or after main or mentor 
sessions or during the class break. I also hold regular office hours. Feel free to drop in during my office 
hours or make an appointment if those hours don’t work for you. You can also send me an email. I make 
an effort to prompt ly (within 24 hours on weekdays) respond to email.  
"If you have a question about course assignments or grades, come talk to me. If you need support in this or "
"any of your other classes, you might chat with your mentor. Mentors are trained to help students  navigate "
campus resources. But don’t worry about who to go to with which question. If your mentor or I don’t 
"have an answer, we will refer you to someone who does. So, if you have questions or need some support, "
just reach out to either one of us. That’s what we are here for.

UNST 11 2A: On Democracy (Reimagining Democracy)  
"Freshman Inquiry, Winter  2024 "

"Mon/Wed 8:00 -8:50, 1:30 -2:00 or by arrangement  "
Course Description:  
Freshman Inquiry is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is Reimagining Democracy) 
"from an interdisciplinary  (incorporating two or more types of knowledge)  perspective. In this course, we "
"will explore how democracy functions and evalua te its relevance in our time of political, economic, and "
"environmental crisis. We will examine how the rise of digital media, polarization and extremism, and "
political paralysis in response to existential issues like climate change pose critical challenges  to 
democratic norms and ideals. We will consider how individual and societal interventions such as media 
"literacy, atrocity prevention efforts, community building, and protest movements can address these "
fundamental challenges to democracy. Students will design and participate in community -based learning 
activities that increase civic engagement and address large -scale social and ecological issues.  
UNST Program Goals:  
"University Studies courses focus on four main learning goals.  Throughout this course, you will develop "
your skills in these areas:  
"Communication:  Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, "
"graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group "
"work, and to be co mpetent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
Critical Thinking and Inquiry:  Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary 
"curricula —problem -posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, "
and empowered learners.  
"Diversity, Equity and Social Justice:  Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and "
social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.  
"Ethics, Agency, and Community:  Stude nts will examine values, theories and practices that inform their "
"actions, and reflect  on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.  "
Course Learning Objectives : 
1. Define the key characteristics of a democratic society.  
2. Critically examine the role that information and disinformation play in fostering a healthy 
democracy and creating an engaged and active populace.  
3. Evaluate how effectively democratic practices adhere to stated ideals.  
4. Apply lessons from historical events and processes to understand the challenges democracies face 
today.  
5. Understand how your own actions can contribute to strengthening democracy.  
"6. Practice communicating across difference and having meaningful, civil dialogues on challenging "
topics.  
Required Ma terials:  
We will continue to use one of our Fall Term texts. A copy the text is  available for limited check out (a 
few hours at a time) in the PSU library.  
"Guzmán, M. (2022). I never thought of it that way: How to have fearlessly curious  "
conversations in dangerously divided times.  Ben Bella Books.   
Additional assigned readings will be posted in our course Canvas shell where you can read them online or 
print them out.  
Course Policies:  
"In this course, we will engage in inquiry -based learning. Unlike traditional modes of learning where the "
instructor presents information and students are tested on their ability to retain or understand that 
"information, an inquiry -based classroom focuses o n exploring ideas and concepts through discussion or "
other participatory activities. This style of education requires student engagement and active participation. 
Our goal is to create a community of teachers and learners where everyone ’s unique perspectiv es and 
experiences help broaden our collective understanding of key ideas and concepts.  
"For this type of learning to work well, everyone has to participate and be involved. The following course "
policies are designed to facilitate inquiry -based learning:  
Participation:  
"Please come to class on time , prepared (with books or assignments, a notebook, and pen)  and ready  to "
"participate. In this class, we will be engaged in discussions and other forms of active learning where every "
"student ’s contribution matters . Your questions, insights, and ideas will help us build our collective "
knowledge base. If you are in class and are not engaged (listening and paying attention even if you choose 
"not to speak)  and/or are disruptive, you may not receive credit for that day ’s work.  "
Electronics:  
"Research shows that even when laptops or tablets are being used for an academic purpose, they can "
"distract from class discussions. No laptop, tablet, cell phone , and ear bud use permitted during class "
time. You will have a break in t he middle of class where you can check your phone or listen to music. But 
"while class is in session, you should put your electronics away. We will occasionally have class activities "
"that require computers. During those activities, you may use your laptop o r cell phone to conduct "
research. You can also use a computer in the mentor lab. I will let you know when the use of personal 
electronics is permitted.   
Assignments/Late work:  
“Finished crap can be edited. Unfinished greatness languishes forever ” ― Margarita Gakis  
"In other words, get it done, and get it done on time!  I don ’t accept late work.  In most cases, students who "
turn-in late work don ’t turn in any higher quality work than those who turn their work in by the due date.  
Part of our learning this year is figu ring out how to prioritize work and how to effectively manage your 
time.  
Let’s Talk  
"No matter how much time and effort you devote to your schoolwork, sometimes life just gets in the way. "
"If something unexpected comes up that prevents you from attending class or completing an assignment, "
"please come and talk to me. If you find yourself struggling to stay motivated or to get work done, let ’s "
"chat. If you don ’t understand an assignment or can ’t make sense of a reading, let me know. FRINQ "
courses are designe d to be supportive. Our goal is to help you develop the skills you will need to be 
"successful in higher education. We don ’t expect you to be a stellar college student right away, but we also "
won’t necessarily know that you are struggling if you don ’t talk to us.  
Your mentor and I are both available to talk to you. You can chat with us before or after main or mentor 
sessions or during the class break. I also hold regular office hours. Feel free to drop in during my office 
hours or make an appointment if th ose hours don ’t work for you. You can also send me an email. I make 
an effort to promptly (within 24 hours on weekdays) respond to email.  
"If you have a question about course assignments or grades, come talk to me. If you need support in this or "
"any of yo ur other classes, you might chat with your mentor. Mentors are trained to help students navigate "
campus resources. But don ’t worry about who to go to with which question. If your mentor or I don ’t 
"have an answer, we will refer you to someone who does. So, if you have questions or need some support, "
just reach out to either one of us. That ’s what we are here for.  
Grading:  
Journal Entry  Assignments :  
"Graded as complete (full points), partially complete (half points), or incomplete (no points). To be grade d "
"complete, a journal entry must be turned in on time, be finished, and demonstrate that you completed the "
assigned readings or activities. It is partially complete if more than 50% of the assignment is finished or if 
you demonstrated that you completed at  least half of the assigned readings. It is incomplete if less than 
50% of the assignment is finished by the deadline or if nothing is turned in. I will not be commenting on 
"every student’s journal each week, but you will receive feedback from me a few tim es during the term. If "
"you don’t receive written feedback, it doesn’t mean that I haven’t read your journal!  "

Yet, what currently sounds more like science fiction is just the beginning of an exciting new era that bears both incredible risks and opportunities for humankind. This interdisciplinary year-long course will delve into the fascinating relationship between non-living and living matter, life and death, nature and the artificial, humans and machines. Our inquiry will start with the fundamental question what is life. How can a finite number of non-living molecules and atoms become a complex living organism with consciousness and moral beliefs? We will explore in what ways human search for perfection is embodied in various myths and utopian visions. What does it mean to be human, cyborg, or transhuman? Nowadays, genetic engineering modifies life and synthetic biology seeks to create it from scratch. However, the social consequences are enormous. Therefore, we will examine the risks and opportunities of such technologies and how they redefine social relations and values. These changes prompt the emergence of new concepts and disciplines, such as biopower, biopolitics, and bioethics that address the new forms of discrimination and social injustice. How do these modifications of life ultimately lead to a redefinition of life itself? Through readings, movies, research, hands-on experiments in designing artificial life systems through simulations, and discussions, the students will study topics ranging from philosophy to arts, from ethics to the evolution of language, from  Christof Teuscher UNST 135A Winter 2024    "
"Jan 21, 2024, Revision 2 "
"law, politics, and religion to economics, and from artificial cells to avatars. The course also offers unique creative, artistic, and educational opportunities for students by using modern simulation software. Learning Goals • Students will understand the complex nature of the central sciences involved in modifying living beings (molecular genetics and synthetic biology) as well as their role in society and culture. • Students will compare various historical and cultural examples of perceptions of life and death • Students will explore and discuss the presumption that science is or can be free of political, economic, social and moral concerns. • Students will examine various viewpoints on the ethical and social issues of modifying life • Students will critically evaluate the role of the media and government regulations with respect to emerging technologies • Students will analyze and articulate the technological barriers that might lead to inequalities with regards to gender, race, class, ethnicity, nationality, sexual identity, ability, and religion, • Students will be able to critically assess the opportunities of improving health and medicine by means of technology. • Students will discuss and propose models for social justice that personally concern them. • Solve problems in a team-based culture using effective communication, cooperation, trust and respect.  • Take advantage of individual thinking styles and cultural diversity to strengthen a team. Important  • This syllabus contains information that will be crucial to your success in this course. Read this whole syllabus carefully, keep it accessible, and refer to it regularly throughout the course!  • Freshman inquiry courses are a full year (3 terms). Students remain in the same class with the same instructor for that year. Moving between sections is only allowed under special conditions and requires approval of both instructors. Similarly, changing mentored sessions will only be allowed with instructor and mentor approval in special conditions.  • The syllabus may be adjusted during the term. Check Canvas for changes. Canvas always contains the most recent and up-to-date information.  • You are expected to read your pdx.edu e-mail on a daily basis.  Course Websites and Learning Platforms • Canvas.

The small size of mentored sessions (~12 students) creates an interactive environment where students get hands-on experience in developing skills in research, writing, communication, and computer technologies. Students learn how to effectively access the Internet, to judge the quality of internet sites, and to use technology to communicate with faculty and other students in class. Unless told otherwise by your peer mentor, the main class rules and guidelines apply to the mentored sessions as well.  University Studies Goals Inquiry based student learning is the cornerstone of the University Studies’ Freshman Inquiry courses.  The goals are to develop those skills that will be crucial to your academic success and beyond.  The four major learning goals of University Studies are (https://www.pdx.edu/unst/university-studies-goals):  Christof Teuscher UNST 135A Winter 2024    "
"Jan 21, 2024, Revision 2 "
"• Inquiry and Critical Thinking. Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula—problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners. • Communication. Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways—writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies. • Diversity, Equity and Social Justice. Students will explore and analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives. • Ethics, Agency, & Community. Students will examine values, theories and practices that inform their actions, and reflect on how personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities. The two things I’m asking you to bring to every class 1. Practice the “campsite rule.” Your presence should make this a better place. o Engage, participate, contribute, do your share. o Do always a little more instead of a little less. o Help others to be successful. That includes your team. 2. A willingness to learn. o Have a growth mindset. o Have intellectual humility and ambition. o Up your game, set high standards for yourself. o Produce work that you can be proud of. o Put yourself in the driver’s seat, don’t blame others. Attendance ""Showing up is 80 percent of life."" — Woody Allen •  • If you want to be successful in this class, you will need to attend both the main and the mentored session. Being on time and seated when class starts is a courtesy to the teacher and to your classmates. It’s also a matter of professionalism and good work ethic. So be on time and ready when class starts.  • Absences can only be excused with documentation. Excusable absence are any absences that are scheduled without your control, e.g., jury duty, court appointments, immigration appointments, competitions (for athletes that are members of official PSU sports teams) etc. Regular doctor’s appointments, DMV appointments, or any other appointments where you can in general chose your appointment day/time, will not be excused. Absences due to sickness require a doctor’s note. • Traffic, issues with public transportation, not being able to find parking, etc., are never a reason for an excuse. Leave a little earlier to account for delays. In addition, the attendance policy allows to unforeseen things to happen. • Your attendance will have to be considered in your self-grading. Active Participation Freshmen inquiry is based on the concept of active learning. Without your full and active participation, we will be missing an essential voice—yours. What you bring to this class is yourself and your desire to participate and to learn. If you want to be successful, you need to be active, engaged, and willing to speak up. We will be learning from each other, and your voice is important. Generally, you should aim to speak up at least once per class session. Important: What is said in the classroom, stays in the classroom. Classroom Etiquette • Arrive on time, be seated and ready when class starts. • Do not leave early, do not start to pack up your stuff before class ends.  • No side conversations.  Christof Teuscher UNST 135A Winter 2024    "
"Jan 21, 2024, Revision 2 "
"• Do not distract others with your devices, e.g., by playing games, checking social media, texting. • Remove earphones and sunglasses. • Respect each other, be kind, show empathy. • Listen, engage, participate, contribute. • Do the work you are supposed to do, e.g., don’t work on other class assignments. If there are deliverables, submit them at the end of the main/mentored session. • Act professionally. • Don’t lose a friend over an argument. • What is said in the classroom, stays in the classroom. • Follow the “campsite rule:” leave the place better than you found it. • Be willing to learn.  Failure to adhere to these guidelines during a given main or mentored session may lead to you being marked absent for that session. Homework For a 5-credit course, you can expect up to 10 hours of homework per week.  Grading and Assignments  ""If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.""  This course will be entirely self-graded. At the beginning of the term, you will define your goals and metrics on how you will measure success. At the end of the term, you will write a self-evaluation, reflect on your performance and contributions in this class, and give yourself a grade.   The table below lists all major assignments (with their due dates) that you will use at the end of the term to give yourself a grade.

How to Ace this Course ""The greatest predictors of student success, as far as student behavior go, are conscientiousness (e.g., work ethic, dependability, and perseverance), agreeableness (teamwork, emotional stability), various kinds of extroversion, and openness to new experiences."" — Paul R. Sackett, Prof. of Psychology at U. of Minnesota in Minneapolis  Here are some key things to do to excel in this course: • Submit all assignments. Submit them on time. Attend class. Be on time. Be active.  • Check Canvas daily. • Read your PSU e-mail daily and respond promptly to e-mails from your mentor or instructor. • Start assignments early, ask me for feedback on drafts. • Do the readings on time, when you’re awake, lucid, and attentive.  Read them before the class when they’ll be discussed. Take notes on them. Digest them. Then go back to them after a couple of days, skim them again, review your notes, and think a little more.  Be ready to ask some reasonable questions about the readings in class.  • Take notes in class. • Participate actively in class discussions.  Be engaged.  Have fun.  Connect the readings to your own life-experience.  • Come to my office hours.  Ask me questions. Show me you care.  How to Get Help with Class-related Things? 1. Post your question(s) in the Canvas discussion forum(s). 2. Ask your peer mentor during the mentored session. 3. Come to my office hour: http://www.teuscher-lab.com/officehour 4. Send an e-mail to teuscher@pdx.edu. I always try to reply to student e-mails promptly, but please do not assume that you will get a reply within hours, especially not after 5pm and on weekends. Due to the high volume of e-mails I receive, my response times can be longer than 24h.  Early Alerts Succeeding in college does not mean that you don’t struggle in a class or classes or during particular terms. My goal as your instructor, and our goal at Portland State, is to do what we can to support all students and facilitate their success. Early Alerts is one of the ways we try to support our students. It’s a process by which your instructor can link you to academic advisors or campus support, and it’s a time for your instructors to let you know what changes you can make toward success in the course and engage in a learning partnership with you. This is a way to open up the conversation between you, your advisor, and your instructor so that together you can work out how to achieve your educational goals. Getting an Early Alert is not an indication that you will not succeed in the course. It is a call to action.  You might get an email or phone call from an advisor. Please engage in this process. Students who have taken advantage of resources offered to them are able to move forward and succeed in the course.  Christof Teuscher UNST 135A Winter 2024    "

"• If you are having technical difficulties with the module contact OIT's help desk at 503-725-HELP (4357) or help@pdx.edu. If you have any questions about the module requirement refer to Safe Campus Module FAQs or contact saveact@pdx.edu. Do not contact your instructor. Title IX Reporting Obligations Portland State is committed to fostering a safe, productive learning environment. Title IX and PSU policies prohibit discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sex/gender and sexual harassment, which includes sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, and stalking. We expect a culture of mutual respect in our department and class. You may report any incident of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, to either the Title IX Coordinator, Office of Equity and Compliance, or the Office of the Dean of Student Life.  Please be aware that as an instructor, I have the responsibility to report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual and relationship violence and/ or other forms of prohibited discrimination to PSU’s Title IX Coordinator, the Office of Equity and Compliance or the Dean of Student Life office and cannot keep information confidential. However, the information will be kept private and only those with a need to know will be provided with what you disclose. If you would rather share information about sexual harassment or sexual and relationship violence to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can contact a confidential advocate at 503.894.7982 or by scheduling online. You may also contact other confidential employees found on the sexual misconduct resource webpage.  Please complete the required student module Understanding Sexual Misconduct and Resources in Canvas, which provides information about PSU policy and resources. You may also report sexual and relationship violence to law enforcement on campus with Campus Public Safety Office (CPSO). Or you may file an anonymous report with Campus Public Safety Office or a Bias Incident report with the Bias Review Team (BRT).  PSU does not typically investigate the reports that are made through these two avenues. These reports help PSU understand what students and employees are experiencing on and around campus and provide support where needed.

"Throughout time, humans have created wo rks of art, seeking to record, manipulate, and transform "
the world around them for the sake of expression or aesthetic enjoyment. Through the study of these 
"works, we are able to understand the range of human experience. This year -long course uses the them e "
"of “The Work of Art ” as a means of exploring a broad range of social, political, and philosophical "
"issues. At the same, it provides students with the tools and resources needed to think, write, and speak "
"critically about the work of art in the broadest s ense and the fundamentals of college -level reading, "
"writing, and critical analysis.  "
"Each term will focus on a different theme presented through scholarly readings, film, and artwork "
that engage works of art the past and present. These sources will serve a s a springboard to class 
"discussions, assignments, lectures, and mentor sessions. Winter term focuses on the theme “Mining "
"the Museum, ” in which we explore the museum as a locus for the construction and display of "
community and identity. Spring will addres s the theme “The City as a Work of Art. ”  
COURSE ORGANIZATION A ND OBJECTIVES  
"Weekly mentor sections will supplement classroom activities, assignments, and discussions.  Our "
year-long course goals will be:  
• to gain an introduction to a range of historical and contemporary perspectives on the theme 
of the work of art  
• to acquire exposure to and eventual mastery of University Studies ’ four learning goals: (1) 
inquiry and critical thinking; (2) communication; (3 ) personal and social ethics; and (4) 
"diversity, equity and social justice  "
• to develop academic and audience -oriented writing skills;  
"• to gain first -hand familiarity with university learning resources, especially Millar Library and "
its collections and databa ses. 
 COURSE MATERIALS  
Required readings and articles can be linked to or downloaded via the course ’s Canvas site  
"Students are required  to buy a College Student Pass for  the Portland Art Museum, available here: "
https://portlandartmuseum.org/plan -your-visit/admission -access -programs/  
STUDENT EVALUATION  
"Students will be evaluated according to the following criteria. Each week, you will be required to 1) "
"attend and actively participate in  class and mentor session, 2) answer 3 -4 questions weekly questions "
"about an assigned reading  that will be posted to Canvas, 3) write a persuasive essay on the "
"Parthenon Marbles debate , due week 5, and  4) complete  a final project , due at the end of the term.   "
• Attendance and active participation in class discussion and in -class presentations – 15%.  As 
"this course will be largely based on discussion of ideas and assigned readings, it is imperative "
that students come prepared daily  to contribute actively  to class discussions and mentor 
sections.  This means reading the assigned work in advance and being prepared to offer 
"quality observations, comments, and/or critiques gleaned from the texts. Half of your "
"participation grade will be  based on attendance, half on the level and quality of participation. "
"Included in this grade are possible in -class writing assignments and reading checks, an array "
"of brief, and/or random quizzes.  If missed, they may not be made up.  "
• Attendance and active  participation in mentor section and associated activities and /or 
completion of exit tickets – 10% 
Weekly Reading Questions (25%)  
"Most weeks you will be assigned a scholarly essay, article, video, or other prompts on that week’s theme. You "
will be required to answer questions about them and come up with a discussion question of your own. 
"Depending on what is indicated on the syllabus , these will be due Monday or Wednesday at 11:59 PM.  "
"Questions should be submitted via Canvas in MS Word or PDF format, and must be double -spaced, "
"normal margins, and at least a page, but no longer than two . They must be written using complete "
"sentences, in formal language free of misspellings and grammatical errors, and citing any references to the text "
"(a simple parenthetical citation is fine, e.g., “Clausen, p. 262”). Because these are intended to be prep aration "
"for in -class discussion, late reading questions will be deducted 1 point per day late.  You are permitted to "
miss one of these assignments without losing points.   
Writing exercise (20%)  
"You will be asked to write a persuasive essay on the Parthen on Marbles debate, due week 5  "
Final project ( 30%) 
"“Remake the Met,” due at the end of the quarter  – details to be announced during the term.  "
"PLAGIARISM POLICY  Plagiarism, intentional or unintentional, is an intolerable infraction in any setting where ideas are "
exchanged and discussed. This includes the use attempting to pass of someone else ’s work as you 
"own, whether another student, AI chatbots, or material fro m websites. It is also a violation of the "
"PSU Student Code of Conduct, and egregious or multiple cases may be grounds for suspension or "
expulsion from the university.  Papers that can be shown to have been plagiarized will automatically 
"receive an “F” grade (or “0”). Remember, ignorance is no excuse! The PSU Code of Student "
"Conduct considers as plagiarism work submitted for other courses and turned into me as original, "
"and I will ask students to submit new, original work in addition to taking the penalties above.  "
STUDENTS WITH DISABIL ITIES AND OTHER RESO URCES  
Students with disabilities who need additional consideration for the timely completion of any of the 
"course requirements should speak to the instructor at the beginning of the term, and must be "
registered with PSU ’s Disability Resource Center ( drc@pdx.edu ).  For information on additional 
"campus resources (SHAC, Career Advising, the Writing Center), contact the instructor.  "
E-MAIL POLICY  
E-mail is an essential t ool for communication between students and the course instructor about the 
"course material, content, and assignments, but please bear in mind the following:  "
• Please do not use Canvas mail; I don ’t get notifications and may not see your message  
• I conside r 48-72 hours to be a reasonable period in which to respond to inquiries.  I am 
"usually much faster than this, but not always.  "
"• I will not, in general, respond to student e -mails received after 5:00 p.m. until the following "
"day, nor will I generally respo nd to student e -mail sent after 5:00 on Friday until Monday "
morning.  Please plan accordingly.  
• Please remember to identify yourself in your e -mail (e -mail addresses alone are often 
inadequate for identifying a student) and state your query as clearly as possible.

Course Description  
Freshman Inquiry (FRINQ) is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is 
Reimagining Democracy) from an interdisciplinary  (incorporatin g two or more types of 
"knowledge)  perspective. In this course, we will explore how democracy functions and evaluate "
"its relevance in our time of political, economic, and environmental crisis. We will examine how "
"the rise of digital media, polarization and extremism, and political paralysis in response to "
"existential issues like climate change, pose critical challenges to democratic norms and ideals. "
"We will consider how individual and societal interventions such as media literacy, atrocity "
"prevention effort s, community building, and protest movements can address these fundamental "
challenges to democracy. Students will design and participate in community -based learning 
activities that increase civic engagement and address large -scale social and ecological iss ues. 
This course is:  
"Writing Intensive  – We will be doing lots of writing, both in and out of class. Much of the "
"writing will be low -stakes, generative and reflective: a way to process what you’re learning and "
"generate ideas for discussion and assignment s. Some of it will be high stakes, edited and "
polished.  
Discussion -based  – Much of what and how you learn will take place from participating in 
discussions with your classmates. This is not a class where you study facts and take a test to see 
how well you memorized them. We are creating knowledge together by talking about and 
creating ideas.  
"Experiential  – In addition to learning about democracy and democratic principles, we will be "
practicing those principles in our activities and assignments. We aren’t ju st reading about 
democracy; we’re going to “do” democracy too.    
Peer Mentor and Mentor Sessions  
"Each FRINQ course has a Peer Mentor, who facilitates mentor sessions and participates in the "
"main class. This person is a trained, upper classman, and an “expe rt student” who supports you, "
"connects you to resources, and helps you succeed in this course and at PSU. Mentor Sessions are "
"one-hour, small group meetings, where you will work on assignments for the class, develop and "
"practice skills, and build closer co nnections with your classmates. Participation in Mentor "
Sessions is mandatory and counts toward your grade for this course.  
University Studies Learning Goals  
All UNST courses focus on the following learning goals.  
Communication  
"Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, graphics, "
"numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group "
"work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
Inquiry and Critical Thinking  
Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula —problem -
"posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, and "
empowered learners.  
"Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice  "
"Students will explore and  analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical "
contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.  
"Ethics, Agency, and Community  "
"Students will examine values, theories, and practices that inform their actions and reflec t on how "
personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.

questions (Critical Inquiry)  
• To analyze and understand audience and how to make rhetorical decisions ba sed on 
specific audiences (Communication)

"historical context, the stakeholders, systems, and impacts on people (Diversity, Equity, "
and Social Justice)  
"• To understand how one's  background, experience, and community influences beliefs and "
values. To seek out and understand a diversity of perspectives on a chosen topic in order 
to form a complex and nuanced understanding of a problem and possible solutions. 
(Diversity and Ethics)  
• To identify possible areas of common ground between diversity of perspectives. (Ethics 
and Social Responsibility)

Course Description  
Freshman Inquiry (FRINQ) is a year -long course that explores a particular theme (ours is 
Reimagining Democracy) from an interdisciplinary  (incorporatin g two or more types of 
"knowledge)  perspective. In this course, we will explore how democracy functions and evaluate "
"its relevance in our time of political, economic, and environmental crisis. We will examine how "
"the rise of digital media, polarization and extremism, and political paralysis in response to "
"existential issues like climate change, pose critical challenges to democratic norms and ideals. "
"We will consider how individual and societal interventions such as media literacy, atrocity "
"prevention effort s, community building, and protest movements can address these fundamental "
challenges to democracy. Students will design and participate in community -based learning 
activities that increase civic engagement and address large -scale social and ecological iss ues. 
This course is:  
"Writing Intensive  – We will be doing lots of writing, both in and out of class. Much of the "
"writing will be low -stakes, generative and reflective: a way to process what you’re learning and "
"generate ideas for discussion and assignment s. Some of it will be high stakes, edited and "
polished.  
Discussion -based  – Much of what and how you learn will take place from participating in 
discussions with your classmates. This is not a class where you study facts and take a test to see 
how well you memorized them. We are creating knowledge together by talking about and 
creating ideas.  
"Experiential  – In addition to learning about democracy and democratic principles, we will be "
practicing those principles in our activities and assignments. We aren’t ju st reading about 
democracy; we’re going to “do” democracy too.    
Peer Mentor and Mentor Sessions  
"Each FRINQ course has a Peer Mentor, who facilitates mentor sessions and participates in the "
"main class. This person is a trained, upper classman, and an “expe rt student” who supports you, "
"connects you to resources, and helps you succeed in this course and at PSU. Mentor Sessions are "
"one-hour, small group meetings, where you will work on assignments for the class, develop and "
"practice skills, and build closer co nnections with your classmates. Participation in Mentor "
Sessions is mandatory and counts toward your grade for this course.  
University Studies Learning Goals  
All UNST courses focus on the following learning goals.  
Communication  
"Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing, graphics, "
"numeracy, and other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group "
"work, and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies.  "
Inquiry and Critical Thinking  
Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula —problem -
"posing, investigating, conceptualizing —in order to become active, self -motivated, and "
empowered learners.  
"Diversity, Equity, and Social Justice  "
"Students will explore and  analyze identity, power relationships, and social justice in historical "
contexts and contemporary settings from multiple perspectives.  
"Ethics, Agency, and Community  "
"Students will examine values, theories, and practices that inform their actions and reflec t on how "
personal choices and group decisions impact local and global communities.
