Instructor,About Erin (your instructor): I have been in Education my entire career though I am fairly new to teaching part -time at PSU. I spent the first half of my career teaching High School Language Arts School in Vancouver and then at David Douglas High School in east Portland. I became interested in design thinking in 2015 after attending a professional development experience alongside students who were participating in a design challenge . I immediately saw the potential for this kind of learning in our public school settings. To me it felt much more relevant and meaningful than what I saw happening on a day -to-day basis in my classroom and in schools In 2016 I took a leave of absence from my classroom role and began learning more about design as a problem -solving methodology. I was in love. To me internal beliefs about people and the world and gave me a process for trying to approach the wicked problems in my own life and beyond with optimism and creativity. I began working for an educational non -profit in Portland teaching educators about the process the process in their curriculums and also about how to use the process as changemakers within our education system. In the couple years Multnomah -Clackamas Regional Educator Network full time design process (aka Design Thinking) to schools in our region and using it to help make our schools more equitable and better places overall for all the humans involved. I have a small family in NE Portland that includes my partner small dog. We like to adventure outside knitting committed soccer player all of my life but mostly play with my old lady soccer team of 20 years now and coach my daughter’s recreational team I’ve enjoyed the experience of getting to work with students and PSU. I was skeptical that the asynchronous/virtual learning could really work for teaching design thinking but I’ve been pleasantly surprised and continue to try to improve that experience for students taking my class.,Erin became interested in design thinking in 2015 after attending a professional development experience alongside students who were participating in a design challenge.

Email,Mentor: Adoria Walker Email: adoria@pdx.edu The Course The heart of this course is reflection on our sources of moral and ethical values. This includes exploring the authority of our sources and the warrant by which we make judgments. Also understand what these elements together comprise our moral lives our moral vision. The course begins with framing the c ore questions and then moves first to some doubts about the truthfulness of value judgments and then to two of the major arguments for such judgments. In the second half of the quarter we look at various accounts of the source of morality: divine judgment rational illumination. I have carefully chosen readings from major philosophers and several important films that help illuminate these questions. All of the readings are primary sources: they deserve  your most careful consideration. Though not long been that the best way to read such texts is a quick preview followed by unhurried reading and then a second or even a third reading with a day or two break in -between. It helps a great deal to have quiet in order to concentrate: headphones may be your best friend for this purpose. We live in times and in a country that demands serious deliberation about our own moral responsibility and civic obligations. Three main class sessions are scheduled as “open / current events.” They are open for further discussion of issues raised in previ ous sessions for new issues and questions events. I will pick a reading on current affairs that has recently been published for at least,Email: adoria@pdx.edu

On Writing Here at PSU our writing philosophy is driven by the idea that writing is a process . This means that any good writer must engage in several steps to produce a good first draft and then c omplete a thorough revision process that will eventually produce a polished and compelling piece. In the words of William Cronon: [E] ducated people know the craft of putting words on paper. I’m not talking about parsing a sentence or composing a paragraph to teach form of touching (Emphasis mine) One thing we will be working on throughout the term is developing your writing skills. We have already begun this process fall term with the use of Peer Review and my own feedback on your papers. This term we will engage in a more detailed process of Peer Reviews. Please make a conscious effort this term to think of your writing not as drudgery but as an art form you are practicing.

Week,Our week-to-week schedule will change slightly or drastically as required by our needs to complete our project. I expect the following of everyone in this class: ●  To participate in our class community through example and intention. ●  To pay attention to meaning created in our “classroom” and community setting. ●  To be open to outcome ●  To practice being ourselves. ●  To make learning fun and engaging. These ideas are adapted from Angeles Arrien’s book “The Four-Fold Way” which supports an individual’s quest for wisdom This class relies on collaborative teamwork as a means for learning learning community in which each person plays a significant role in the total group’ s intellectual growth and performance. In order for everyone to achieve this must work together to maintain positive interactions and show tolerance and interest in each other ’s progress. Therefore learning environment and celebrate each other ’s diversity and diverse backgrounds. W e will take the time to recognize each other ’s experiences and listen with respect. A key aspect of this course comes through each of us bringing our learning and experience from our individual lives to the classroom setting so that we might all expand  our understanding of the issues we face in our communities and the threads that connect us to them.  The diversity each of you brings  to this experience is a resource strength respectful of this diversity .

The key to success in this class is showing up and engaging with the material. • You have engaged deeply with the material assignment • You’ve committed yourself to working in the spirit of the class. Some of what we do in here is unconventional and you may be resistant.  Your willingness to let go of judgement and res istance you what you can to help foster a sense of connection and community in this classroom – to engage with this class with a “we” mentality and to recognize yourself as an integral part of the whole.

The course uses no textbook and involves little formal lecture. The learning you accomplish in this course will take place largely through your own effort and the efforts of those with whom you work. The use of collaborative inquiry takes account of the fact that the modern sciences questions they address wish to create a context within which this sort of teamwork is required to tackle the problems put before you. As you will see right away lectures and textbook reading assignments that charac terize many science courses. Instead learning in Natural Science Inquiry is accomplished through inquiry -based projects on a variety of topics. The successful completion of these projects requires that you: (1) work independently and collaboratively use computers to analyze and interpret data a poster. Student learning in this section of Natural Science Inquiry As outlined above directed projects and inquiry. This section of NSI is asynchronous online do not have set meeting times.
