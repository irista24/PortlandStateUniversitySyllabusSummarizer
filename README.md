Hi everyone! This was my first attempt at creating a machine learning model! This model is capable of summarize PSU syllabi that are uploaded by students. I created 
everything from the frontend to the backend. This experience was definitely a learning experience and am forever indebted to Professor Teuscher for his immense support 
and knowledge that he bestowed on me. If you have any questions on the code or would like to read more, email me at ita@andrew.cmu.edu. You can read more on my process of
creating the application here: https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&context=altreu_projects Pages 178-184
