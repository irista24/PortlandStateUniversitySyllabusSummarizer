WPA brought creativity and equity to workplaces and created opportunities for artists to make a living at their work. From 2017–2020 WPA operated MATTER a storefront artspace and residency program in Inner SE Portland focused on building opportunities for socially engaged artists to experiment exhibit and sell their work. In 2014 I earned an MFA in Contemporary Art and Social Practice from Portland State University. As an artist I utilize a multitude of media and forms to explore concepts like vulnerability solidarity and pleasure. My projects o use dialogue or oral histories to build relationships and community and create opportunities for collaborative public engagement. My work manifests in the form of books installations printmaking events performance and more.A few of my projects and exhibitions include: Art Talk Bus Stop (producer 2019–present) a youth education program/podcast and KBOO Community Radio show where high school students interview artists and creatives about how they do their work and how they make a living Nobody Wants to Work Anymore (artist Nov 2022) a solo exhibition on the duality of labor and value in the contemporary workplace and Obscurity: Life Inside the Smoke (curator/artist Sept–Dec 2023) an exhibition about the human relationship with wildﬁre smoke through the interpretation of six Portland area artists at the World Forestry Center in Portland OR in which I worked with incarcerated wildland ﬁreﬁghters to create an interactive installation. I have been an artist in residence at Casa Tres Patios in Medellín Colombia ValueType=""40"" ValueFormat=""_($* # and PLAYA at Summer Lake OR (2020/21) and at Nafasi Art Space in Dar es Salaam Tanzania ValueType=""40"" ValueFormat=""_($* # where I have produced exhibitions publications and workshops. In addition to my art background I have over ValueType=""40"">15 years of experience as a producer project manager and art director both at production and design agencies and on independent projects. I’ve been part of the PSU community since moving to Portland in 2008 ﬁrst as a Producer/Director of multimedia projects then as a graduate student and Teaching/Graduate Assistant in the MFA in Contemporary Art &amp; Social Practice and now as an adjunct faculty member in University Studies as well as the Co-Chair and Chair of Political Action for our adjunct faculty union PSUFA . When I’m not teaching making art or organizing in my community I enjoy traveling backcountry expeditions gardening and cooking live music and dance parties. Cam Ericksen (they/them ) I am a mixed-race two-spirit queer counseling student with a focus in relationship and family therapy. I currently serve as a counselor intern at William Temple House in NW Portland as I ﬁnish the last year of my Masters program. A few other things about me aside from being a student and a counselor-in-training I have hobbies in gardening and ceramics am partnered enjoy kayaking with friends and love to cook. I completed my undergraduate degree at PSU and am familiar with numerous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,resources on campus so please never hesitate to reach out to me (ce7@pdx.edu). The,,,,
,,,,mentor role is one I value and appreciate for the interdisciplinary learningcommunity we create together. While there are a few things I can share and oﬀer to you the students I work with consistently bring a wealth of knowledge and experience that inﬂuences my understanding and work as a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,mentor with UNST. I look forward to our work together this term!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Instructor Communication/Role: I am available some,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekdays during business hours ValueType= a.m. – ValueType= p.m. via,,,,,,,,,
,email. I aim to respond to your,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,email within ValueType= hours. I generally do not respond on the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekends or on school holidays. I am happy to make arrangements on an individual-basis for zoom oﬃce hours. Please send an,,,,,,,,,
,email request to my @pdx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,email to arrange a Zoom meeting if the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly standard times don’t work for you. I encourage your communication so please don’t hesitate to be in touch! My job is to serve as a facilitator advisor and to be an honest vulnerable supportive co-learner in our community. Our work together should build a context for thinking more deeply as we explore design thinking through a community-based lens. Communication is key to collaboration and building relationships. I hope to provide you opportunities to get to know your classmates as well. Your,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Mentor is responsible for giving you guidance on assignments feedback and facilitating group work during your,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Mentor Sessions. Workload This class is ValueType= credit hours (most PSU classes are within the 3-6 range). One credit is equivalent to approximately one hour of lecture or class per,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week or two hours of lab/studio activity per,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week. PSU advisors usually recommend at least ValueType= hours of work time outside of class per,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week for every credit hour of lecture or class. Since this is a ValueType= credit course and is activity-based (not lecture) you should allow 3-4 hours per,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week to absorb course content through readings videos podcasts and participating in small group discussions about the course content. This includes a,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Mentored Discussion which will take place in Canvas. You should allow approximately 2-4 hours per,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week for working on your Human-Centered Design Project. This will stretch over the entire term structured through a series of,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly assignments. More on Assignments below.Required,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,Materials I believe in an accessible education. I have selected and uploaded,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,materials that are free for you to download watch or listen online. ● Texts/Content:,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,attendance participation in discussion assignment completion etc. We understand that your lives won't be the same,,,
,,,,,,,,,week-to-week and some,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weeks will be harder/busier than others - one,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week will not make or break your,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,grade in this course. However,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,attendance is mandatory and we only meet once per,,,
,,,,,,,,,week so students who miss ValueType= classes will be subject to failing. This is a fast paced course and you will struggle if you do not plan your work time and turn in,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly assignments on time. If you feel you are falling behind reach out to me immediately!,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Weekly Discussion Participation &amp; Response Each,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week you will be assigned read/watch material about concepts that relate to the design thinking process and your Community Based Theme. You will cultivate a classroom community through conversations about the course content in your,,,,,,,,,

ValueType= words for responses B - Student may be missing one or two of the above components but mostly completed the assignment as described. C - Student made may be missing several components but completed the assignment. Students who are working below this level of quality are subject to failing,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,grades. Overall Course Evaluation Your evaluation is based on the learning demonstrated by your contributions to our,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,mentored,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly discussions,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly sketches/writings and human-centered design project. This course is evaluated using a number of American Academy of Colleges and Universities VALUERubrics. Within each 8-point rubric there are the following three categories: ● Emerging 70-79% (C-/C) ● Proﬁcient 80-89% (B-/B) ● Exemplary 90-100% (A/A+) You will take part in a variety of evaluation methods: self-evaluation peer evaluation and,,,,,,,,,
instructor/mentor feedback. If you fall below the “Emerging” range on any piece of coursework we will discuss the work and talk about ways to get into the Emerging-Proﬁcient range. All students are expected to fall in the Emerging-Proﬁcient and above range in the majority of their course work across our learning. At midterm wewill have check-ins with everyone to give verbal feedback on your work as well as hear how your design process is going. This will also be an opportunity to brainstorm and ask questions. Policies: Presence and participation are required. Consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly participation is expected and required both in class content and,,,,,,,,,

About Erin (your instructor): I have been in Education my entire career though I am fairly new to teaching part -time at PSU. I spent the first half of my career teaching High School Languag e Arts School in Vancouver and then at David Douglas High School in east Portland.  I became interested in design thinking in 2015 after attending a professional development experience alongside students who were participating in a design challenge .  I immediately saw the potential for this kind of learning in our public school settings.  To me it felt much more relevant and meaningful than what I saw happening on a day -to-day basis in my classroom and in schools In 2016 I took a leave  of absence from my classroom role and began learning more about design as a problem -solving methodology.  I was in love.  To me internal beliefs about people and the world and gave me a process for trying to approach the wicked problems in my own life and beyond with optimism and creativity.  I began working for an educational non -profit in Portland teaching educators about the process the process in their curriculums and also about how to use the process as   changemakers within our education system.  In the couple years Multnomah -Clackamas Regional Educator Network full time design process (aka Design Thinking) to schools in our region a nd using it to help make our schools more equitable and better places overall for all the humans involved. I have a small family in NE Portland that includes my partner small dog.  We like to adventure outside knitting committed soccer player all of my life but mostly play with my old lady soccer team of 20 years now and coach my daughter’s recre ational team I’ve enjoyed the experience of getting to work with students and PSU.  I was skeptical that the asychronous/virtual learning could really work for teaching design thinking but I’ve been pleasantly surprised and continue to try to improve that experience fo r students taking my class.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Communication is key and collaboration with me and your fellow learners are essential for us to thr ive in this class. Student Workload: It is important to be able to budget your time for this class by thinking through the time you will need to complete your work and build community.  Most courses at PSU are offered for 3 -6,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,credit hours. One credit is equivalent to one hour of lecture or class per week (or two hours of,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,lab or studio activity per week).,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,PSU advisors usually recommend at least two hours of study time per week for every credit hour of lecture or class.  Since this is a 4 credit course course content through readings The additional credit hours are made up of the 3 virtual small group meetings you will attend in,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week 4,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,You should allow approximately 2+ hours per week for working on our Community -Centered,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Design Project (this will stretch over weeks 4 -10) and includes weekly assignments (see below). Required Texts:,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,● I will provide any weekly content in the form of a rticles or videos. ● As far as additional expenses glue Course Vision: Our Course (in a nutshell) As of late school of Art and Design demand (whichever you prefer). As design thinking has risen i n popularity differing opinions about it mindsets to creatively solve problems in new and meaningful ways. Course Goals As members of this learning community ● learn the basic tools and mindsets of Design Thinking and practice those tools in iterative cycles of design ● become familiar with the process of design thinking as it pertains to community - centered design ● identify processes key issues through stepping into a human -centered design process,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,● use technology to mobilize themes a community -centered design in response to key issues Through the course goals and outcomes key university studies areas: inquiry and critical thinking experience Course Outcomes ● Evaluate based themes. ( UNST Inquiry and Criti cal Thinking Goal )
,,,,,,,● Make connections between course materials and hands -on experience collecting field research about community -based themes through a community -centered design process. ( UNST Inquiry and Critical Thinking and Diversity of Human Experience Goals ) ● Learn and use diverse forms of communication (blogging reflective writing) to nurture relationships within small groups based th eme included. ( UNST Communication Goal ) ● Use empathy practices including sustained observation and deep listening to read interpret Human Experience and Ethics and Social Responsibility Goals ) ● Analyze written and hands -on best practices in community - centered design to create a proposed design.

Evidence of this work will take place in PRAXIS journals and the cu lminating community -centered design assignment. ( UNST Communication and Ethics and Social Responsibility Goals ) Some Essential Course Questions: How is empathy and building an understan ding of multiple perspectives an integral part of design thinking? What types of communication are used in design thinking? Why are different forms of communication so vital to the design thinking process? Why is it important to dig into ethical questions when it comes to design? What does social responsibility look like when it comes to design and/or design thinking? How does stepping out of the classroom into the world uncover deeper truths/questions abou t a subject/idea? How is design thinking applicable to almost anything and everything?

,,,,,Course Description : This course will focus on the introduction of women’s studies and sexuality studies as an academic field of study. Goals for this course is to increase knowledge of the role of gender in culture critically on these issues and increase understanding for bringing about justice for the lives of historically underrepresented people in our culture. Additionally the goals of this course is to have fun while we create a collaborative understanding of the history ideology through critical analysis and advance academic excellence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Objectives: •Develop critical thinking •Learn proper citation and writing skill  •Understand the basic principles of Feminism and its applications •To be able to analyze a diversity of perspectives as opposed to a monolithic or dichotomous perspective •To analyze power relations and develop an understanding of issues that make up the everyday lives of historically underrepresented people •Develop s kills to take action based on the principles you learn •To build a community of learners committed to helping one another through the learning process To bring about these goals it is important that we learn in community and that each member of the community assumes responsibility for their own judgments and learning within this community. This means coming to class prepared (having done all the readings ) ready to ask questions and respond to others questions and respecting one another with compassion for each other’s different perspectives. _____________________________________________________________________ Land Acknowledgment Portland State University sits on land carefully tended by the Chinook -speaking peoples of Multnomah community loss of life endure at the hands of white settlers/colonizers and their descendants.

Then think about something you can do to effectuate some change on this issue. Your actions must be new to you (please don’t ask to do an act based on something you did last summer) and the activity must be about gender/sexuality (I appreciate that you already do work outside of school volunteeri ng for animal rescue or helping the homeless or advocating for medical marijuana but this act is about gender/sexuality specifically). It could be something that speaks to gender collectively Don’t hesitate to think of the act intersectionally ageism individual project. The outrageous act is being active awareness of those around you. If you work in a group member effectively. One group member may be a good writer; another may be good at convincing others to take actions terrible artist Some examples: *Don’t shave or use make up for a month *Add up how much you spend on make up cupcakes and sell them in the park blocks: Charge men $1 and women 75 cents to make a point about women making 75 cents to a man’s dollar *One student sold cupcakes she ma de with vaginas on them and donated the proceeds to a battered women’s shelter *A student with long hair cut it almost all off and donated the hair to an organization that helps people with cancer have wigs *Sit down with yer grandma (or elder woman in your life) and talk about they handled their period in the 30’s before tampons *Learn to knit and make re -usable tampons or pads for yourself or donate them to a country where girls don’t have any sanitary pro ducts and can’t go to school You will present your final project on Canvas to the rest of the class in its own Canvas thread,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,during the last week of class. Please write for 300 -500 words and answer these questions: 1. Pre,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,Extra credit is not formulated into the regular grade system cuz it’s an option. It is not worth the usual one point per assignment.  If it were in the formula then those folx who chose to opt out,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,would get dinged points. Does that make sense? I can’t put a  line item in the grades for extra credit because that would mean everyone is responsible for extra credit whether you did it or not. So if you don't do it,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,track of any extra credi t you do and adding it into your final grade at the end of the term. So for example If I see you’ve registered to vote,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,week then I will totally move you up to an A. But if I see that you are not really participating in class or just generally don’t seem to care then yeah Here some ideas for extra credit *Go to http://oregonvotes.org/  and register to vote turn it in. I will give you points for registering and points for actually voting. Please take a photo or screen shot from registration website or scan an image of your ballots (black out personal info like yer phone# or address). If you are not a US citizen someone who is to register and vote. *Read one of the books from another book group and write a 500 word review. All writing guidelines apply. *Got a n idea for extra credit? Let me know and we can discuss it,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Grading   The grades themselves (which are an average of Main session and Mentor session grades) are not exact numbers that add up to 100%. that’s why it’s an “A” RANGE or “B” RANGE etc. For example for an A+ (unless my math is wrong but this is all just to give you estimates it’s not an exact science). 64-71 points = A range 57-63 points = B range 50-56 points = C range 43-49 points = D range 42 points and lower is failing These numbers may change as I add/delete assignments My two requirements for this class is to 1) show up and 2) do the work. If you do one but not the other you might be able to pass the class but you will not get an A. Please don’t tell me “I hope I will pass the class.” Tell me what work you have done and how you propose to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,an A. Take responsibility for yourself. Your overall grade for the class will be determined by,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,your participation. You can keep track of your grade on Canvas as we go along I will be posting your points on Canvas as you go so you can keep track of your points yourselves. Please don’t ask me to keep track of your points for you for me and you are big kids now and can take care of yourselves UNST -233A (SINQ) Global Perspectives Winter ValueType= - Online (Asynchronous),,,,,,,,,,

Students explore the forces of tradition and modernity nationalism colonialism and empire and globalization and development. Exploration of perspectives attitudes and beliefs of another culture/region informs students of the interconnectedness of human experience that frames contemporary global interactions. This course is designed for students with little or no previous study of or experience living in dif ferent regions in the world. The course is also suitable as a ‘stand-alone’ course either for those interested in a global education of non-western societies wishing to expand their knowledge of global perspectives beyond their area of specialization. Content and Structure The course is intended as an introduction rather than as a survey and is composed of a broad cultural-geographical introduction followed by,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly modules that provide a series of pertinent topics that examine specific themes such as music food climate change and human traf ficking. The approach is multi-disciplinary and takes the historical context into consideration. Each module structures with a core text including readings and films. Themes A number of themes are given particular emphasis throughout the course:○ The Impact of the W est through colonization; economic political and cultural globalization ○ Cultural traditions that have shaped and continue to shape cultural identity ○ The individual and society Learning,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,materials and check all due dates and deadlines on the,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,calendar . Consider setting up electronic reminders if time management is a challenge for you. ○ Check Canvas announcements DAIL Y . I post regular reminders and other,,,,,,
,,,,,,,materials. ○ Block out time for your online class. Set personal,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,weekly times for “attending” your online class just like attending a campus class. Y ou should reserve the time equivalent to that time you would spend in class plus the study time outside of class. ○ AL W A YS start on your work early in case of a computer problem—don’t wait until the last minute.

It is important that you read carefully in order to ensure that you are able to discern and include the most important arguments from the readings you cover . ValueType= Analysis of significance of reading and its contribution to Global Studies : The second section of the post should be an analysis of the significance of the readings both to everyday life and to theory {based upon what you have read in this course}. What you write in this section should ef fectively answer thequestion “Why do the readings matter?” and should logically follow your argument and analysis in the preceding section. ValueType= Use APA (American Psychological Association Style Guide or Manual) when citing in the text and adding the reference at the end of your discussion. The title of your post should list the reading(s) you are discussing and who wrote them.

,,,,,,,,,weekly topic at hand or extend the argument proposed in the reading of your choice into new terrain or connect concepts found within the text or outside. The question(s) will be,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,graded on thoughtfulness and how ef fective a tool it is for promoting discussion. ValueType= Y ou are required to “Reply” or respond to at least one other group members’ post to earn full points. Additional Notes: Late work will be,,,,,,,,,,

Reading Annotations The Reading Annotations are an opportunity to engage with the readings and your peers online through an application called Hypothesis.

,Mentor: Kara Jinks     Email: jinks@pdx.edu ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The Course Every human endeavor of history itself process and is an agent —in particular quarter we will think about the implications of our relationship to the past the historical study in our own lives in our own day. To do this areas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,The first part of the course (weeks 1 to 4) explores the basic types of interpretation of the past about remembering and forgetting in writing a bout history. We then turn to the two most common types of thinking about how to interpret our relation to the past. One is based on viewing the collection and interpretation of facts and data as true representations of the past. The other holds that truth  in history resides in the accounts of the past that we create.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,The second part of the course (weeks 5 to 6) surveys the fundamental in philosophy of history as developed during its “canonical” period in the first half of the nineteenth century. These ide as shaped the modern world.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,The third part of the course (weeks 7 to 10) is devoted to another form of philosophy of history that interprets the past as the ethical ground of our relations to one another than as an account of the past. This is ext remely provocative offers us a chance to think about what it means to be human and to live in responsibility to others in the light of our relationship through history to the whole of the rest of humankind. In the last we ek we will look at extending this approach to history to the non -human world All these theories deeply concern how we understand the human relationship to loss and change and to the trans -generational community of humankind. Throughout the course we will consider the moral demands that the past does or does not make on us. The term paper is your own historical study of an original source of knowledge about the human past of your own choosing history you r own and to reflect on its relation to you and your relation to it. I encourage each of you to explore the subjects and inquiries that interests you individually through taking time to deliberate the ideas to be presented and through doing your research f or the term paper. The classes will be informal lectures the readings Note This course does not use Canvas. This classroom is screen -free.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,The grading is guided s elf-grading. Please visit me to discuss papers appointment! ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Attendance,,,
,,,,Please attend all class and all mentor sessions. Not merely attend: please pay attention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,through all class sessions. Extend attendance into attention; attendance is almost nothing without attention. Your attention aloud and silently thing you can do in this course. Much of the material concerns how to look at observe and inquire into history —how to make history present to you and how you might be present in history. Above al l Please bring copies of the texts under discussion with you to each session.  This is part,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,of attendance.,,,
,,,,,,,,It will not be possible for you to get an A term grade if you miss more than three  (3) class sessions (not counting the first session),,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,be possible for you to get a term grade better than a C - if you miss more than five (5) class sessions (not counting the first session),,,,,,,,,,
,,,,of your mentor sessions is required on the same basis. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Class discussions This course will largely consist of class discussions mixed with informal le ctures. For this purpose Come to each class with questions about the texts. Speak up to ask about what you do not understand Students pa rticipate in classes in all kinds of ways without speaking. Because of the nature of moral and ethical reflection course more on discussion than on lecture. Please feel free to ask any question or to stat e any point of view.  Please practice the norms of courtesy to one another and tolerance for the opinions of others. Many students are reluctant to speak in class consequently I do not like to call on students. But I do not kn ow which students are comfortable with being prompted and which are not. I will observe your wishes in this respect at all times. You do not have to raise your hand to speak. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Computers This is a screen -free classroom . The use of computers digital devices during main class sessions is not allowed except (a). in cases of requests for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,reasonable accommodation submitted through the Di sablity Resources Center or (b). upon application to me for consideration of circumstances justifying the necessity of using a device. If you do have an individual need of a device A phone call or message requires immediate response is of course an exception to this rule. Please leave the classroom to respond. I leave this in your hands; no explanation will be necessary. The work in this course is chiefly close readi ng of texts and discussion purpose printed (“hard”) copies are far and away better suited than electronic display.  Our work in class needs no simultaneous online research. From long experience I earnestly advice you to take notes by hand rath er than to type them. This enables better focus on the lecture and better participation in the discussion typing in notes at a later time gives you a chance to review them. If you have an individual need of a device Please bring the texts we are to discuss to each session. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Grading,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,This is a self -graded course.  This means that the term grade in this course will be,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,guided  by your evaluation of your own work. Your self -grading is a matter of being in good conscience; thus,,,,,,,

This includes exploring the authority of our sources and the warrant by which we make judgments. Also understand what these elements together comprise our moral lives our moral vision. The course begins with framing the c ore questions and then moves first to some doubts about the truthfulness of value judgments and then to two of the major arguments for such judgments. In the second half of the quarter we look at various accounts of the source of morality: divine judgment rational illumination. I have carefully chosen readings from major philosophers and several important films that help illuminate these questions. All of the readings are primary sources: they deserve ValueType= your most careful consideration. Though not long been that the best way to read such texts is a quick preview followed by unhurried reading and then a second or even a third reading with a day or two break in -between. It helps a great deal to have quiet in order to concentrate: headphones may be your best friend for this purpose. We live in times and in a country that demands serious deliberation about our own moral responsibility and civic obligations. Three main class sessions are scheduled as “open / current events.” They are open for further discussion of issues raised in previ ous sessions for new issues and questions events. I will pick a reading on current affairs that has recently been published for at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,some of these open sessions; I’ll email this to you a  week or so ahead. The classes will be discussion in the discussions is vital to the course. To learn the most from this course texts before class meets and bring printed copies of the texts to class movies before class meets. In this course I use the word “ethics”and “morality to mean the same thing. Some people draw sharp distinctions between the ethical and the moral a matter o f convenience.

For this purpose Come to each class with questions about the texts. Speak up to ask about what you do not understand Students participate in classes in all kinds of ways speaking. Because of the nature of moral and ethical reflection more on discus sion than on lecture. Please feel free to ask any question or to state any point of view. Please practice the norms of courtesy to one another and tolerance for the opinions of others. Many students are reluctant to speak in class I do not like to call on students. But I do not know which students are comfortable with being prompted and which are not. I will observe your wishes in this respect at all times. You do not have to raise your hand to speak. ++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Computers This is a screen -free classroom . The use of computers devices during main class sessions is not allowed except (a). in cas es of requests for reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you do have an individual need of a device A phone call or message requires immediate response is of course an exception to this rule. Please leave the classroom to respond. I leave this in your hands; no explanatio n will be necessary. The work in this course is chiefly close reading of texts and discussion ValueType= purpose printed (“hard”) copies are far and away better suited than electronic display.  Our work in class needs no simultaneous online research. From long experience I earnestly advise you to take notes by hand rather than to type them. This enables better focus on the lecture and better participation in the discussion typing in notes at a later time gives you a chance to review them. If you hav e an individual need of a device Please bring the texts we are to discuss to each session. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,,,,

Or are there several rules?  If so actions that are decisive in assign ing praise and blame to the one responsible?  Or then again mistake to concern ourselves solely with rules vice?  In the end virtues and that a virtue -based conception of ethics is deficient without rules for deciding between right and wrong. Course Requirements 1.

In other words conclusion that you already believed to be true Carefully e xplain your reasoning process . [B]  a subject about which you have changed  your mind .  What did you use to believe do you think differently than before?  Explain the process of rational deliberation  (or moral deliberation Note: Do not just narrate your ‘experien ce’ or describe your ‘journey’.  And there’s no need to recount the course material (except as it helps you answer the questions)  Rather: describe or explain the process by which you reasoned your way to the conclusions you arrived at.  Due Sunday Outline of Course  Modules All references are to The Fundamentals of Ethics  (sixth edition) University Press Module 1: Introduction (reading: Introduction) We’ll begin  this term attention to how moral reasoning is supposed to work and assess the theories we’ll study.  There will be some technical terms introduced as well that we have a  common vocabulary for some of what is to come. We’ll introduce the subject -matter consider some features of moral argumentation. Module 2:  Relativism 22) We’ll look at considerations about the status of ethics and whether we can have knowledge of right and wrong.  We’ll discuss cultural relativism  (the theory that moral judgments are always and only indexed to a specific society o r civilization cultures and through history) .  We’ll also discuss subjectivism of right and wrong are merely expressions of the feelings and attitudes of the speaker (and are ipso fa cto true,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,whole enterprise of ethical deliberation?  Or might there be objective standards of right and wrong? Module 3: Egoism In this module egoism. Psychological egoism  is the descriptive and explanatory theory that people cannot help but act in their own self -interest (thereby sharply restrict ing what is possible for people to do,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,and making a mockery of our ordinary expectations and assessments of one another).  It’s a serious challenge to what we are up to this term meanwhile We’ll see whether it makes sense.  Module 4: Pleasure and Happiness (reading: Chapter s 1 &amp; 2) What has value?  What has moral worth?  What kind of thing is suitable for moral beings to pursue?  Hedonism  says that pleasure is the good We’ll look at some merits and difficulties with this theory of value. Module 5:  Does Morality Depend on Religion? (reading: Chapter 5),,,,,
,,,,,,,,,In this week’s material Theory of Morality   If someone says that right and wrong are determined by the will of God what assumptions are being made?  And what further questions or dilemm as does that account of morality raise? Module 6:  Consequentialism and Utilitarianism (readings: Chapters 9 &amp; 10),,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,This week consequences) Utilitarianism  (according to which the right thing to do is to maximize happiness).  How is that supposed to work as a moral theory Module 7:  Kantian Absolut ism (readings: Chapters  11 &amp; 12) In this module fruitfully thought of as a response to the objections against utilitarianism and some concerns about theocentric ethics.  Kant believ es that there are absolute moral rules which shouldn’t be broken Module 8:   Social Contract Theory (reading: Chapters 13 &amp; 14) To begin which  prompts an attempt to construe morality as the constrained maximization of self -interest. This is known as the Social Contract Theory of Morality —our subject for this module.  Might morality be construed as a form of rational or prudent fulfillment of self -interest? Module 9:   Virtue Ethics (readings: Chapters 17 &amp; 18) In this module Ethics .  Here we will have looked at in modules 4 -8.  All along rules should I follow?   But virtue ethics asks instead: what kind of person should I be?  By looking at the virtue ethics approach of rule -based theories of morality.

The course uses no textbook and involves little formal lecture.  The learning you accomplish in this course will take place largely  through your own effort and the efforts of those with whom you work.   The use of collaborative inquiry takes account of the fact that the modern sciences questions they address wish to create a context within which this sort of teamwork is required to tackle the problems put before you. As you will see right away lectures and textbook reading assignments that charac terize many science courses.  Instead learning in Natural Science Inquiry is accomplished through inquiry -based projects on a variety of topics.  The successful completion of these projects requires  that you: (1) work independently and collaboratively use computers to analyze and interpret data a poster. Student learning in this section of Natural Science Inquiry As outlined above directed projects and inquiry. This section of NSI is asynchronous online do not have set meeting times.  All the lectures acces sed at your convenience.  Throughout the term you are expected to work collaboratively on a variety of connected projects that ultimately lead to the design communication of a natural science experiment .  The results of the final project will be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
communicated to the c lass and the instructor through a scientific poster . Course Goals Students will: • View science as a process for creating knowledge. • Be familiar with the basic characteristics of natural science research. • Distinguish science from pseudoscience. • Evaluate and critique knowledge claims. • Recognize and understand scientific  literature. • Examine the role and influence of science in society • Use computers  and statistical software ( CRAN R) as a research tool. • Design and conduct a  natural science experiment . • Improve their ability to communicate scientific research through poster presentations . • Recognize the power and limits of science as a way of creating knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you read this over ValueType= million people around the world can’t go home safely. This is the largest number of forcibly displaced people in the history of the world. Nearly half of them are children. Many of these people have found new homes in Portland whether as refugees immigrants asylees or something we don’t have a word for. In this class we will study the global phenomena of displacement and migration as well as some of the local successes and challenges newcomers face here in Portland. All of us who live work and study here are stakeholders in this important conversation. This class is designed to better equip you to understand first-hand the complexities of the conversation about immigration and refugee resettlement and to give you the tools and understanding to make informed responsible choices as a student citizen and stakeholder . We will study current and historic trends in immigration and refugee resettlement at the global national and local level with an emphasis on East Portland including successes and challenges faced by immigrant and refugee communities and the institutions that serve them. As a Capstone course field work plays an important role in this class. We will partner with the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization a Portland-based non-profit with nearly ValueType= years of experience serving refugees immigrants and other newcomers.University Studies Goals The University Studies Goals are an integral part of this course offering. You will see these themes show up in our classroom activities and assignments throughout the term. I’ve attached specific UNST Goals to each of the course goals listed above so you have a sense for how they relate to our course themes. Here’s the full text for each of the University Studies Goals: C ommunication - Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways—writing graphics numeracy and other visual and oral means—to collaborate effectively with others in group work and to be competent in appropriate communication technologies. I nquiry and Critical Thinking - Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula- problem-posing investigating conceptualizing- in order to become active self-motivated and empowered learners. D iversity of Human Experience - Students will enhance their appreciation for and understanding of the rich complexity of the human experience through the study of differences in ethnic and cultural perspectives class race gender sexual orientation and ability. E thics and Social Responsibility - Students will expand their understanding of the impact and value of individuals and their choices on society both intellectually and socially through group projects and collaboration in learning communities. Course Goals By the end of the course you should be able to: • Analyze and think critically about rhetoric pertaining to immigration/refugee settlement I • Understand contemporary and historic trends in immigration/refugee resettlement I D • Understand current migration trends at the national &amp; local level I D • Recognize your role as stakeholders in migration discourse E • Communicate complex ideas about immigration and refugee resettlement in various ways including writing group projects and on-line discussions C • Appreciate the complexity and diversity of East Portland’s communities D Course Design This course may feel different than other courses you have taken in the past.

Plagiarism and Student Conduct A productive learning environment relies on our adherence to PSU Codes of Conduct: http://www .pdx.edu/dos/policies-codes-of-conduct-at-psu. In particular please note that plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. If you are quoting or relying heavily on another’s work in your written assignments or class presentations you must acknowledge the source appropriately . A Note About Chat GPT We think in language. One of the reasons you are at PSU is to train yourself to think. All of our writing and reading assignments exist to help you learn. Chat GPT and other AI platforms can complement learning but if you use them to read and write for you all you are doing is robbing yourself of the chance to learn. Ultimately it’s up to you if you want to give yourself the opportunity to learn and hone your thinking. nan Multimedia Production Team Capstone Revised Winter 2024 Winter   / 2024 January 8 - March 23  /Access course 24/7 Online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the unlikely event that a student is significantly disruptive Service -Learning Planning and Participation Policies: Requirements for participation in service -learning planning  will be outlined in the “Introduction”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,item for ea ch week. Planning will take place in your group’s service -learning discussion forum unless the group chooses an alternate method (like Discord). Planning will have two goals: a. planning the logistics of the service activity itself b. determining who will pr oduce which rhetorical output  (type of communication) Participating in planning each of these two goals will be worth 5 points for a total of 10 points. Full credit will be given for active and prompt participation that moves the group forward to its goals. Partial credit is available. Students who do not participate in planning will have decisions made for them ValueType= Students will receive full credit for participating  in the service activity i tself if they actively and respectfully participate in  the expected work: ex. helping maintain paths deliberative discussion activity must reach out to Arwen or Dave abo ut an alternative discretion,,,,,,,,,

Extensions on Work: If you need an extension of up to a few days on an assignment additional time you need at least 24 hours before the assignment is due . We will then agree on a new due da te. If the work is not submitted by the date we agree on be assessed based on the extended  due date. This policy is designed to encourage personal agency and responsibility in managing workload and due dates. Homework Format: Major as signments must be typed bold ) No Heading Penalty: You must put your name on all your work . This is an expectation in most professional writing. A heading  usually states your name paper. To avoid the no heading penalty PENALTY:  You will lose 0. 5 points if a submitted written assignment does not include a HEADING. Exceptions: discussion forum posts Vocabulary: Heading vs. Header : A “heading” includes your name and other identifying information top 1/2 inch of your pages where page numbers go (and sometimes you name as well).   6 Revision Policy: Revising work is vital to a successful writing process.

If you are unable to keep up with the work of the course during the first half of the term possible. Plagiarism It is cheating to pass off the wor k of others as your own.  This includes using the words of others without attribution (be sure to use quotation marks and indicating the source of the words) and,,,,,,,,,,
using the words of your fellow students.  Your instructor takes such violations of the ethical  code very seriously and will penalize violators as severely as the university allows.  Consequences can include failing the class and having the violation noted on your permanent university record. Canvas has a Turn -It-In function that enables you to see if you are using other people’s work or not. But note that you may have a high score simply because you have quoted other people’s work Accessibility It is Portland State Unive rsity's goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible.

By treating popular culture as a subject of rigorous scholarly inquiry critically Specific Course Descrip tion This course is designed to introduce the student to the critical study of popular culture through the focus of fairy tales. We are surrounded by fairy tales and their echoes adaptations in our daily lives TV shows immersed in elements of fairy tales in our daily lives critically analyze.

weekly basis. You will be assigned readings by the instructor your own and bringing your findings back to your classmates where everyone can engage in a discussion. In this way There are also individual assignments essay.

You will also have the  opportunity to develop skills in using digital video to present your ideas powerfully in one of today's most influential pop culture forms. Collaborative Sophomore Inquiry is a quarter -long course based on the principle that facul ty and students should collaborate to form an interdisciplinary classroom environment in which we all learn from one another. You will be expected to conduct primary and secondary source research and to bring what you learn back to class dis cussion as well as your research project. In keeping with this philosophy critique with your classmates throughout the course. Your success depends on your peers' careful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Challenging Oppression and Hierarchy We will approach the class by recognizing that all participants valuable knowledge to contribute as co -learners. Each of us will bring different perspectives and insights to the course and respecting those differences will be crucial to having rewarding learning experiences together. Many of these differences are not merely the result of personal choices. They reflect the ways we are caught up in complex structure s of social hierarchy Because of this well as those conveyed through the pop culture we study.

,,,,,,,,,you need  to set aside 8 -12 hours per week to work on things for this class. I am aware that some students think that general education courses should be less work than others simply not true. This is a four -credit course course. I recognize that many of you have a lot of other responsibilities in your life you to be realistic about how much you take on. Taking a full -time course load is as time -consuming as holding down a full -time job. I d o not assign anything that is “busy work. ” All the assignments and quizzes have been developed through years of teaching experience reflection. If you are ever uncertain about the purpose of an assignment it. I want you to leave this course with a lot of new insight about how pop culture both shapes and reflects the world in which we live and with skills in conducting research and harnessing pop culture forms to commun icate your ideas effectively through video speech develop crucial transferable job skills that other courses usually don't or can't spend time on --,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,discussing will be difficult and thus attendance in class is necessary. Participation can look like many different things: participating in small group discussion speaking in class your phone or laptop) Entry/Exit Tickets 20% - At the start and close of each class students will ha ve 10-12min to fill out an entry and exit ticket. A different entry/exit prompt will be given each day. It is your responsibility to fill out and turn in your entry/exit ticket. I will provide a small notebook that will be passed out and picked up before and after the entry and exit prompt. Entry/Exit tickets are due the day of,,,
,,,,,,,,,and cannot be turn in late. Not including the first and last week there are 16 days of class which means 16 entry ticket and 16 exit tickets (this will be adjusted if class is cancel led for whatever reason). Each ticket is worth 2 points (4 points possible for the day). You will receive 1 point for a basic response that do not reference class readings or themes. You will receive 2 points for a thoughtful response that references clas s readings and themes. While this assignment allows for a possible maximum of 64 points this assignment will be out of 50 points. This means you can miss up to 3.5 days,,,,,,,,,

Engage each other in conversation.  Each person will talk about their project and as a group you will engage in conversations about each person’s projects. That might look like others adding information addressing current events that relate to someone’s project projects together. You will not be judged on the quality of recording (but we must be able to understand/hear it). Your podcast should have a name and you should introduce,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,yourselves at the start. We will listen to everyone’s podcast during the last week,,,,,,,,,

Course Description Our Freshman Inquiry is a yearlong interdisciplinary class that uses the University Studies goals Inquiry and Critical Thinking Communication Diversity Equity and Social Justice and Ethics Agency and Community to explore the subject of PORTLAND. In this course you will explore the city and ideas related to place placemaking and what it means to be a citizen now and in the past. You will practice writing research and critical thinking setting you up for success in your college career (and your life). FRINQ courses take an inquiry-based approach to learning asking you to pose questions and explore answers using curiosity as your guide . You will learn how to research ideas and information and how to write and communicate in a variety of styles. You will also develop various tools to help you analyze what you read hear and see. Inquiry involves a constant and active conversation between reading writing re and analysis. For this course our texts will include not only books articles videos and images but also the spaces places and people around us. This fall we will focus on how to use primary sources such as newspapers magazines historical documents and maps. Some questions we’ll consider include: What elements have created the Portland we live in now? What is “sense of place” and what is its importance? How do we investigate and understand historical change in a city? What does it mean to be a citizen of a city? Students with diverse backgrounds and experiences come together to take this class and everyone is encouraged to share their experiences with the class. Main sessions will consist primarily of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
instructor-facilitated discussions and student-facilitated discussions. It is critical that you come to class prepared to engage in an active discussion with the class. ValueType= Every class has a set of values that drive it both explicitly and implicitly. Understanding and articulating these values such as we can is a useful process in order to answer the questions “Why are we here? Why is this important? How does this material impact me and my communities?” As the course spools out these ideas will develop. But to begin I give you these ideas about what I hope you get from the course: ValueType= Learn to respect your intellectual life and education as a gift that no one can steal from you and of which you are the chief agent. ValueType= Learn how your everyday life is connected to historical systems of oppression like racism colonialism and sexism. ValueType= Understand how you can connect through your thinking and writing and talking both inside and outside the class ideas of personal and community responsibilities for historical systems of hierarchy and power including both bene and su ValueType= Learn to use and respect your voice as an agent of change as you see it. ValueType= Work at your highest level in this course through respecting your own e rising to external challenges and recognizing internal challenges. ValueType= Make connections between your lived experiences and the material &amp; processes of the class. Recognize the skills you are learning and their applicability in both your academic and professional lives. Course Policies Come to class prepared to participate and engage with your classmates.

,Email:  thorsrud@pdx.edu Above Welcome to the second term of Portland FRINQ! This term we will explore the Portland of the recent past and present. What made Portland  a “model” city that was recognized for its innovative politics and cultural scene in the recent past? What issues and choices has Portland grappled with during the pandemic and social uprisings? We will address these questions and others through a variety  of texts and assignments meant to develop your competence in each of the four goal areas of the University Studies program : • Communication • Critical Thinking and Inquiry • Diversity •  Ethics Two main texts and contexts  through which we will view the Portland: Charles Heying’s analysis of “Portland’s Artisan Economy” as examined in his book  Brew to Bikes   (See above) “Portlandness” as it is examined in  Portlandness: Reserve in the Library) THIS IS AN EBOOK Research and Inquiry  will be a central theme of this term. We will engage in traditional research project.   Another fundamental skill we will focus on is the “Quantitative Literacy” aspect of the UNST Communication goal. We will study how people communicate with numbers and what numbers and statistics can tell us about ourselves and the city.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Winter Learning Objectives 1 Develop a working knowledge of creating statistical pictures. Learn about analyzing and displaying data. 2. Explore and examine narratives that attempt to conceptualize Portland as a place such as the concept of Artisan culture/economy as it is articulated in Charles Heying’s Brews to Bikes  and “Portlandness” as it is arti culated by geographers David Banis and Hunter Shobe in Portlandness: a Cultural Atlas. 3. Develop skills that inform different ways of seeing community surveying 4.  Explore what it means to do research at a college level. Read and utilize information from writing texts like They Say 5. Begin to fles h out and articulate a “Life Mission” by reflecting and researching your goals and filling out your “Professional Growth” section in the ePortfolio. Course Policies : See your fall syllabus for details. All policies remain the same.   For your convenience po licies have been posted in Canvas under: Course Policies. On Writing Here at PSU our writing philosophy is driven by the idea that writing is a process . This means that any good writer must engage in several steps to produce a good first draft and then c omplete a thorough revision process that will eventually produce a polished and compelling piece. In the words of William Cronon: [E] ducated people know the craft of putting words on paper. I’m not talking about parsing a sentence or composing a paragraph to teach form of touching (Emphasis mine) One thing we will be working on throughout the term is developing your writing skills. We have already begun this process fall term with the use of Peer Review and my own feedback on your papers. This term we will engage in a more detailed  process of Peer Reviews.   Please make a conscious effort this term to think of your writing not as drudgery but as an art form you are practicing. Winter Term Assignments:,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,Engagement and Reading Responses 15 %  of your grade Just like last term you will be  evaluated for your contributions and engagement in our shared learning community. This can take many forms but certainly showing up each time we meet and engaging with other students would be appreciated by all of us as we struggle to build a community en tirely online. There will be readings for most class sessions . You should post a reading response for each text . This term let’s challenge ourselves a bit more. NEW POLICY: You must post both your own original response (based on Critical Thinking not your feelings please) and respond to at least one other post . In addition thoughtful video response on 4 of the 10 reading responses.  YOU WILL BE ASSIGNED A TEAM TO LEAD A DISCUSSION ON ONE OF THE TEXTS. Time Management Assignment  10%  In response to your reflection papers from last term as well as the course evaluations how you spend your time.

In remembering these communities their legacy Welcome back to your Portland FRINQ! Throughout this term project. You will start by developing a research topic that  relates to our class theme. This is an essential part of the research process will use your inquiry skills to think carefully about what you want to learn and why. With guidance from me determine and refine you r topic and research question. Topics might range from community gardens gentrification in the city (these are just a few ideas . . .). You will conduct extensive research to first compose an annota ted bibliography a nd then develop a research essay that focuses on a particular research question that relates to that topic.

,,,,,,,,,you will write weekly QQRs. You will a lso continue to expand your communication and critical thinking skills and social justice inform our actions. Portland has at times been viewed as one of the most “livable” cities in the United St ates. At the same time Portland continues to face challenges when it comes to issues such equity term with a complex understanding of the concept of “livability” as you consider issues of access As we continue to examine Portland this quarter ValueType= ● How do people experience the city of Portland —as long -term or new residents of the city? ● What are the elements that make up a city and how do these elements contribute to life in the city? What do es it mean to be a “livable” city? ● How can we “map” or understand different aspects of the city? ● What are some of Portland’s assets as a city? What are some of the challenges we face and how might we address those challeng es? University Studies goals: Inquiry and Critical Thinking: Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary curricula — problem -posing Communication : Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various ways —writing other visual and oral means —to collaborate effectively with others in group work communication technolog ies.

,,,,,,,,,Assignment is more than one (1) week late:   -20%,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Work will be accepted for late credit up to Friday  of Week 1 0. At my discretion extension  beyond this  for the final major assignment Extensions on Work: If you need an extension of up to a few days on an assignment additional time you need at least 24 hours before the assignment is due . We will then agree on a new due date. If the work is not submitted by the date we agree on be assessed based on the extended  due date. This policy is designed to encourage personal agency and responsibility in managing workload and due dates. Homework Format: Major assignments must be typed bold ) No Heading Penalty: You must put your name on all your work . This is an expectation in most professiona l writing and is good to practice. A heading  usually states your name at the top of your paper. To avoid the no heading penalty name.  NO HEADING PENALTY:  You will lose 0.5 points if a submit ted written assignment does not include a HEADING. Exceptions: discussion forum posts heading. Vocabulary: Heading vs. Header : A “heading” includes your name and other identifying information 1/2 inch of your pages where page numbers go (and sometimes you name as well).

,,,,Peer Mentor:  Allen Bakira Library Liaison:  Kimberly Willson Course  Description This course explores the interconnectedness of global social systems  and our impact on the world we share with all living beings. Last term we explored how our cultural perspectives shape how we see ourselves in relation to the larger world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and how our modern food system has impacted the environment and critical resources.  This term we will focus on two key challenges that could destabilize society and critically impede our ability to build a sustainable future: 1) the prolifer ation of disinformation  and a growing distrust of institutions and of science; and 2) climate change. We will delve into  the benefits and risks of social media  and AI disinformation . We will talk about the scientific method and how science is  mis-interpreted by and mis-represented  to the public . We will explore  the fundamentals of climate change and the threats  it poses. And we  will look beyond the problems themselves and think how we can craft solutions for reducing vulnerability and building resilience. Required Texts You do not need to buy a text for this term’s class. We will utilize various sources for readings this term. These will be posted on CANVAS along with the schedule for readings (see the back of this syllabus) . Here is a link to a webpage  to help you navigate CANVAS . ValueType=,,,,
,,,,,,Specific objectives for this term are for you to better understand: • Sources of and strategies behind disinformation and the threats posed by disinformation • How social media and AI are changing society and the human experience • Science • Uncertainty in measurements and models • Earth’s climate and climate drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,• Energy resources • Feedback loops and tipping points • Climate change impacts on societies and the environment • Individual and collective responses to climate change • Specific skills we will focus on include: • Recognizing false claims • Fact and source -checking • Quantitative literacy and reasoning • Literature - and measurement -based research • Familiarity with spreadsheets and dealing with large data sets • Research -based writing &amp; the use of APA -style formatting for citations and references • Group work • Presentation skills,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Course Policies and Expectations Classroom Environment A healthy classroom – a place of questioning commitment both as professor and students to care. I am hopeful that we can make our shared class space a thoughtful place to help each other process and deal with all that i s happening now and to think earnestly about how to shape a more positive future. You may hear statements make no sense from your point of view. It is important to remember that students come to Portland State University from diverse backgrounds and bring with them a wide range of perspectives. It is not necessary that you like other people’s opinions or that they like yours. It is necessary for you to listen to and engage others with respect. You should do your best to come to class having completed assigned readings and ready to engage with the material for the day and with everybody else in the room. Engagement requires attention. Please do not distract yourself or others by eating in the cla ssroom texting starting to gather your papers before the class is excused.,,,,,

My hope is that these practices will help plant a seed of inspiration and allow you to imagine what is possible. The goal for this term is to build on the foundation that we created in this classroom last term. Now that we are more comfortable with each other short readings are going to lead us deeper into some of the topics we brushed upon last term We may b e delving into issues surrounding mental health immigration Talking about these issues might lead us into uncomfortable territory and may require us to take some risks with one another. With that in mind tools you need to navigate these potentially uncomfortable conversations. As we continue with our free writing practice lyric essay as a form that will help you string together the myriad topics that we  are exploring in this class. My hope for this term is that you all continue to show up regularly take us what we might want to carry into spring term.

Most of the assignments are designed to prepare you for the class activity or discussion scheduled on the day that your work is due.  So doesn’t necessarily make sense to do it after the fact.  It is for this reason that I prefer  not to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,accept late work. There may be times when you have missed class and need to make up assignments.  In that case with me ahead of time to make this arrangement .  So please me if you need extra ti me on an assignment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Attendance Policy: Please come as often as humanly possible.  I know there are challenges.  I know that the transition into college can be an emotionally trying time struggling to maintain our mental health. We all have those days when it is a struggle to just get out of bed of this class. Together we can try to bring as much joy and creativity into this learning commun ity as possible; together we can create a space that where you want to show up order to do that we need each and every member of this class to be here. This is a very interactive passively and not participate. It’s very important that you keep that in mind.  In order to truly succeed and flourish as part of this learning community and engage with the material and with each ot her. Please do your best to arrive on time. It’s really important for the general flow of the class.  If you arrive late absolutely must miss class that you missed. Cell Phone Policy: Same as last term,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Grading: In all my years of teaching clear feedback to student work.  I enjoy that part of the learning/teac hing process and feel it is essential to fostering student growth.  However with to it using a system of measu rement based upon a pre -determined set of standards and outcomes. That very act puts me in a position of power that runs counter to my teaching philosophy and to the kind of community I am trying to foster in this classroom.  I am not here to judge you; I  am here to encourage you questions to the possibility of transformation. I generally begin e ach fall term by reading about and discussing what it means to be an educated person and what role a university might play in helping to create such a person. Many of us have,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,been socialized to believe that the grade we receive for a course is a true indicator of what we learned only an outside authority figure or institution can determine the value of our learning.  As a result simply to receive information,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,reprimanded) by an outside authority with a grade,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,this information.  I believe this style of grading feeds into a system of oppression that impacts our learning and our personal growth in negative So,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,course.  You will be the person who determines what grade you receive at the end of the term.  I will be providing you with feedback and input along the way.  I will also be marking off completed assignments on Canvas,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,few weeks into the term identify your goals for the course and decide upon markers that will help you to achieve these goals (more details regarding this to come – rest assured the term course,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,and you will use these as tools to help determine what grade you have earned in this course.  For some of you this may feel like a daunting task.  With that in mind I believe full involvement in this course looks like .  This clear • You have come to at least 90% of our classes on time,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,present and engaged.  To put my feelings about attendance into perspective,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,I used a traditiona l grading system and participation. This is not an online course.  The key to success in this class is showing up and engaging with the material. • You have engaged deeply with the material assignment • You’ve committed yourself to working in the spirit of the class. Some of what we do in here is unconventional and you may be resistant.  Your willingness to let go of judgement and res istance you what you can to help foster a sense of connection and community in this classroom – to engage with this class with a “we” mentality and to recognize yourself as an integral part of the whole. One important caveat:  I reserve the right to require you to have a conversation with me if your assessment in your self -evaluation seems to m e to be either artificially high or artificially low.  In that event the term.  The “M” will stay on your transcript for only one term and is not permanent. However following term is your responsibility to understand the implications of both an “M” and an “X” on your transcript Side Note: I realize this caveat seems rather intimidating.  I considered rewording it to make it softer seriously and don’t mistake my untraditional approach as a ticket to an easy A .  One thing I should clarify  is that I will have individual conferences with each of you at the end of the,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,term  to discuss your grade and to just talk about how things are going in general. If there is,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,any discrepancy between the grade you assigned to yourself and the grade I think you earned By remaining in this course requirements,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Academic Integrity: All work turned in must be your own and it must be work that you have done specifically for  this course.  If you submit work that you already turned in for another course for that assignment.  More importantly work with the questions/comments you are turning in next class providing citations papers.  Plagiarism will result in a zero on the assignment and can result in further sanctions including dismissal from Portland State University.

It is based on a concept of collaboration and commitment among the faculty characterized by respect and responsibility. Learning occurs through participation in collective and individual efforts. The goals of University Studies (of which Freshman Inquiry is only your first step) are to develop and strengthen skills th at will be crucial to your academic success and lifelong achievements. Achieving these goals will result in: • A set of conceptual tools for critical thinking and inquiry • An ability to use key modes of communication  such as writing discussion • A deeper understanding of diversity identity and power relations in the past and in our own times • An awareness of crucial issues involving ethics  and social responsibility These four general goals constitute the necessary conditions for achievement in a broad array of professions. FRINQ classes approach them from an interdisciplinary perspective  in preparation for more advanced study. Furthermore cultural practices and critical modes of thought. It is important for you to focus on  these goals throughout the year Course Fo rmat: The course material consists of critical research Classes will be conducted in mixed format combining lectures discussions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,Required Course Materials : There will be no books to purchase this term. All readings will be made available online through Canvas. Course Content This course examines the nature and history of public health as fundamental human right. A social justice approach will be used to study the places in which people live and interact the community social determinants of health or the circumstances in which people are born play economic forces and impact the general “happiness” in our society. Historical and contemporary case studies will help us understand power relationships as access to (or lack thereof) health service complex issues but the readings and assignments are designed to introduce you to ideas that will apply to your other classes as well as your own life experience. In the fall term  we explored various aspects of social and racial injustice in public health and education through the lens of human rights. We also began the important process of becoming critical thinkers and getting to know each other and establishing an atmos phere in the classroom of trust in each other and for our ideas. We will continue to explore the themes of this class by deepening our understanding of global injustices in multiple directions. In winter term of human rights and health concerns in the era of globalization and climate change . We will explore aspects of global injustice through research and artistic ways for its critique. We will focus on global crises  related to the availability of water and food environmental disasters . We will challenge our first -world assumptions about health and human rights. We will develop the skills for writing a research paper . In spring  term community -based learning projects. You will be working with people in the community who are impacted in very real ways by social disempowerment and how they find creative solutions.  Thus the focus will be on various political and  social movements of empowerment . We will question what our own responsibilities as members of society are; what are the ethical boundaries of promoting one’s own perspective . Thus developing our understanding of diverse perspectives and empathy. In terms of skills working on how to communicate your experience in leading class discussions and writing a letter to a policy maker .,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,Learning Objectives:  Learning objectives for the course are based on the UNST four goals. To achieve them 1. Practice the conceptualization and expression of ideas. 2.

Keep in mind these touchstones  that will help to guide our class discussions. • Encourage an environment of respect  where differing points of view and experiences are recognized. • Allow room for others to speak and raise your hand so that the class has time to recognize who wants to spea k (we will try to use the “raise hand” function in Zoom).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,• Cell phones and other technology generally prevent us from being fully present in a conversation (this applies to remote conversations as well). • Recognize and respect forms of nonverbal communicatio n. • Embrace active listening as essential to creating a good dialogue.
,,,,,,,,,,,Assessment and Grading,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,Note: CANVAS is not a grading tool Assessment in this class is based on formal assignments and class participation. List ed below is a,,,,,,,
